Knowledge bases such as Wikidata, DBpedia, YAGO, or the Google Knowledge Vault collect a vast number of facts about the world. But while quite some facts are known about the world, little is known about how much is unknown. For example, while the knowledge base may tell us that Barack Obama is the father of Malia Obama and Sasha Obama, it does not tell us whether these are all of his children. This is not just an epistemic challenge, but also a practical problem for data producers and consumers. We envision that KBs become annotated with information about their recall on specific topics. We show what such annotations could look like, how they could be obtained, and survey related work.
