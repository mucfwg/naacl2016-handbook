This paper describes our participation in SemEval-2016 Task 5 for Subtask 1, Slot 2. The challenge demands to find domain specific target expressions on sentence level that refer to reviewed entities. The detection of target words is achieved by using word vectors and its grammatical dependency relationships to classify each word in a sentence into target or non-target. A heuristic based function then expands the classified target words to the whole target phrase. Our system achieved an F1 score of 56.816\% for this task.
