This paper describes the system submitted by IHS-RD-Belarus team for the sentiment detection polarity subtask on Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis task at the SemEval 2016 workshop on semantic evaluation. We tried an approach to the polarity detection task based on an artificial neural network. Evaluation on the test data set showed that our system achieved the F-score of 0.83 for restaurants domain (rank 4 out of 28 submissions) and F-score of 0.78 for laptops domain (rank 4 out of 21 submissions).
