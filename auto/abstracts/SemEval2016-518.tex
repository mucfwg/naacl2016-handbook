In this paper we describe our approach to the Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) parsing shared task as part of SemEval 2016. We develop a novel technique to parse English sentences into AMR using Learning to Search. We decompose the AMR parsing task into three subtasks - that of predicting the concepts, the relations, and the root. Each of these subtasks are treated as a sequence of predictions. Using Learning to Search, we add past predictions as features for future predictions, and define a combined loss over the entire AMR structure.
