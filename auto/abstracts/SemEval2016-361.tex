This paper details the participation of ISTI-CNR to task 4 of Semeval 2016. Among the five subtasks, special attention has been paid to the five-point scale quantification subtask. The quantification method we propose for this subtask is based on a standard document-by-document regression method, to which a compensation for error caused by the bias of the model towards high prevalence labels is applied in order to produce the quantification estimates.
