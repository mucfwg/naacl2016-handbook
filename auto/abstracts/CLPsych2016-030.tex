This paper presents a system capable of performing automatic triage of forum posts from ReachOut.com, a mental health online forum. The system assigns to each post a tag that indicates how urgently moderator attention is needed. The evaluation is based on experiments conducted on the CLPsych 2016 task, and the system is released as an open-source software.
