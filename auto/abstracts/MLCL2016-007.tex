Researchers have shown that a wordnet for a new language, possibly resource-poor, can be constructed automatically by translating wordnets of resource-rich languages. The quality of these constructed wordnets is affected by the quality of the resources used such as dictionaries and translation methods in the construction process. Recent work shows that vector representation of words (word embeddings) can be used to discover related words in text. In this paper, we propose a method that performs such similarity computation using word embeddings to improve the quality of automatically constructed wordnets.
