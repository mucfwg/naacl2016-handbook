We describe a question answering model that applies to both natural images and structured knowledge bases. The model uses natural language strings to automatically assemble deep networks from a collection of composable neural modules. Parameters for these modules are learned jointly with network-assembly parameters via reinforcement learning, with only (world, question, answer) triples as supervision. Our  approach, which we term a \_dynamic neural module network\_,  achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets in both visual and structured domains.
