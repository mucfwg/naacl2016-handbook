This paper focuses on identity-of-sense anaphoric relations, in which the sense is shared but not the referent. We are not restricted to the pronoun ``one'', the focus of the small body of previous NLP work on this phenomenon, but look at a wider range of pronouns (''that'', ``some'', ``another'', etc.). We develop annotation guidelines, enrich a third of English OntoNotes with sense anaphora annotations, and shed light onto this phenomenon from a corpus-based perspective. We release the annotated data as part of the SAnaNotes corpus. We also use this corpus to develop a learning-based classifier to identify sense anaphoric uses, showing both the power and limitations of local features.
