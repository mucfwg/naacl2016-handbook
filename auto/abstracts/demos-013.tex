We present an extension to Appraise, an open source toolkit for human evaluation, to integrate eye-tracking functionality. Our goal is to analyze the human evaluation process based on the information collected from the gaze data. We modified the user interface (UI) for Appraise to communicate with an eye-tracking device, and collect the gaze data. Gaze signals captured by the eyetracker during the evaluation process, augmented with the word coordinates in the UI, results in gaze data. Such data i) invites researchers to propose models to predict human scores, ii) can serve to analyze evaluation process. To this end, we provide an analysis module, based on data collected during the evaluation session and the additional eye-tracking features.
