We detail our approach to the CLPsych 2016 triage of mental health forum posts shared task. We experiment with a number of features in a logistic regression classification approach. Our baseline approach with lexical features from a post and previous posts in the reply chain gives our best performance of 0.33, which is roughly the median for the task.
