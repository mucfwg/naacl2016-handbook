Resolution of the anaphoric entities in natural language text is very much essential to extract the complete information from the text. In this paper, we present a methodology to resolve one of the difficult pronouns, plural pronouns with split antecedents in Tamil. We have used a salience measure based approach with salience factors obtained from sub-categorization information of nouns and selectional restriction rules of the verbs. We have evaluated our approach with Tamil novel corpus and the results are encouraging.
