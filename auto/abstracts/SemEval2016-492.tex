This paper describes the VCU systems that participated in the Semantic Taxonomy Enrichment task of SemEval 2016. The three systems are unsupervised and relied on dictionary-based similarity measures. The first two runs used first-order measures (lesk and first-order vector), and the third run used a second-order measure (second-order vector). The first-order measures obtained a higher Wu \& Palmer score than the second-order measure in the test data. All three runs obtained a higher Wu \\& Palmer and F1 score than the random baseline but not the first-word first-sense baseline.
