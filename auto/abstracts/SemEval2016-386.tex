Automatic enrichment of semantic taxonomies with novel data is a relatively unexplored task with potential benefits in a broad array of natural language processing problems. Task 14 of SemEval 2016 poses the challenge of designing systems for this task. In this paper, we describe and evaluate several machine learning systems constructed for our participation in the competition. We demonstrate an f1-score of 0.680 for our submitted systems - a small improvement over the 0.679 produced by the hard baseline.
