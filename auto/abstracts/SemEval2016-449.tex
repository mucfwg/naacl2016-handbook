This paper describes the polarity classification system designed for participation in SemEval-2016 Task 5 - ABSA. The aim is to determine the sentiment polarity expressed towards certain aspect within a consumer review. Our system is based on supervised learning using Support Vector Machine (SVM). We use standard features for basic classification model. On top this, we include rules to check precedent polarity sequence. This approach is experimental.
