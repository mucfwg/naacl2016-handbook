We propose a simple graph-based method for word sense disambiguation (WSD) where sense and context embeddings are constructed by applying the Skip-gram method to random walks over the sense graph. We used this method to build a WSD system for Swedish using the SALDO lexicon, and evaluated it on six different annotated test sets. In all cases, our system was several orders of magnitude faster than a state-of-the-art PageRank-based system, while outperforming a random baseline soundly.
