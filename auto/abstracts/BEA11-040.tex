We present a novel situational task that integrates collaborative problem solving behavior with testing in a science domain. Participants engage in discourse, which is used to evaluate their collaborative skills. We present initial experiments for automatic classification of such discourse, using a novel classification schema. Considerable accuracy is achieved with just lexical features. A speech-act classifier, trained on out-of-domain data, can also be helpful.
