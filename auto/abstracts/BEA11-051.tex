We applied two standard, open source tools for detecting spelling and grammar errors to the AESW 2016 shared task: After the Deadline and LanguageTool. The tools' output was combined with a Maximum Entropy machine learning model to classify each input sentence as requiring or not requiring any edits. This approach yielded the second-highest precision of 64.41\% in the binary estimation task at AESW 2016, but also the lowest recall of 36.85\%, resulting in an F-Measure of 46.34\%.
