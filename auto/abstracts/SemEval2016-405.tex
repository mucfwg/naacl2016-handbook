This paper describes an approach used to solve Aspect Category Detection (Subtask 1, Slot 1) of SemEval 2016 Task 5. The core of the presented system is based on Supervised machine learning using bigram bag-of-words model. The performance is enhanced by several pre-processing methods, most importantly by a term substitution technique. The system has reached a very good performance in comparison with other submitted systems.
