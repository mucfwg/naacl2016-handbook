A prior study found that on average there are 6.3 named mentions of organizations found in email messages from the Enron collection, only about half of which could be linked to known entities in Wikipedia. That suggests a need for collection-specific approaches to entity linking, similar to those have proven successful for person mentions. This paper describes a process for automatically constructing such a collection-specific knowledge base of organization entities for named mentions in Enron. A new public test collection for linking 130 mentions of organizations found in Enron email to either Wikipedia or to this new collection-specific knowledge base is also described. Together, Wikipedia entities plus the new collection-specific knowledge base cover 83\% of the 130 organization mentions, a 14\% (absolute) improvement over the 69\% that could be linked to Wikipedia alone.
