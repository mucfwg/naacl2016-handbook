In this study, the problem of shallow pars- ing of Hindi-English code-mixed social me- dia text (CSMT) has been addressed. We have annotated the data, developed a language identifier, a normalizer, a part-of-speech tag- ger and a shallow parser. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to attempt shallow parsing on CSMT. The pipeline developed has been made available to the research commu- nity with the goal of enabling better text anal- ysis of Hindi English CSMT.  The pipeline is accessible at [http://bit.ly/csmt-parser-api].
