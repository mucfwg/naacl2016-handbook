This paper contains the description of our participation at task 4 (sub-task A, Message Polarity  Classification)  of  SemEval-2016.   Our proposed   system consists   mainly   of                                             three steps. Firstly, the preprocessing step includes the  tokenization  and                                            identification of special elements including URLs, hashtags, user mentions and emoticons.                                            The second step aims at selecting and extracting  the  feature  set.                                             Finally, a supervised approach, in particular a Support Vector Machine has been applied to tackle the classification problem.
