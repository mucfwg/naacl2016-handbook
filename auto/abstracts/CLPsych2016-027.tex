The 2016 CLPsych Shared Task is centered on the automatic triage of posts from a mental health forum, ReachOut.com. In this paper, we describe our method for this shared task. We used four different groups of features. These features are designed to capture stylistic and word patterns, together with psychological insights based on the  Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) word list.  We used a multinomial naive Bayes classifier as our base system. We found that we could extend the number of training samples by using a semi-supervised approach and labeling some of the unlabeled data to use them as training samples.
