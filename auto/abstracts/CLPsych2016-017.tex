The ReachOut clinical psychology shared task challenge addresses the problem of providing an automatic triage for posts to a support forum for people with a history of mental health issues. Posts are classified into \verb+green+, \verb+amber+, \verb+red+ and \verb+crisis+. The non-green categories correspond to increasing levels of urgency for some form of intervention. The Thomson Reuters submissions arose from an idea about self-training and ensemble learning. The available labeled training set is small (947 examples) and the class distribution unbalanced. It was therefore hoped to develop a method that would make use of the larger dataset of unlabeled posts provided by the organisers. This did not work, but  the performance of a radial basis function SVM intended as a baseline was relatively good. Therefore, the report focuses on the latter, aiming to understand the reasons for its performance.
