In this paper, we describe the development of a morphological analyzer for learner Hungarian, outlining extensions to a resource-light system that can be developed by different types of experts. Specifically, we discuss linguistic rule writing, resource creation, and different system settings, and our evaluation showcases the amount of improvement one gets for differing levels and kinds of effort, enabling other researchers to spend their time and energy as effectively as possible.
