Affective computing has a commercial side. Numerous products and projects provide sentiment, emotion, and intent extraction capabilities, applied in consumer and financial markets, for healthcare and customer care, and for media, policy, and politics. Academic and industry researchers are naturally interested how sentiment and social technologies are being applied and in commercial market opportunities and trends, in what's being funded, what's falling flat, and what's on business's roadmap. Analyst Seth Grimes will provide an industry overview, surveying companies and applications in the sentiment and social analytics spaces as well as work at the tech giants. He will discuss commercialization strategy and the affective market outlook.
