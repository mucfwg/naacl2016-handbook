In this paper, we use insights from Minimalist Grammars (Keenan and Stabler, 2003) to argue for a context-free approximation of discontinuous structures that is both easy to parse for state-of-the-art dynamic programming constituent parsers and has a simple and effective method for the reconstruction of discontinuous tree structures. The results achieved on the Tiger treebank -- paired with state-of-the-art constituent parsers such as the BLLIP and Berkeley parsers -- both improve on existing transformation-based approaches for representing discontinuous structures and the state-of-the-art results of Fernandez-Gonzalez and Martins (2015)
