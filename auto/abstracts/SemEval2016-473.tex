This paper presents our system description submitted to the Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis Task of SemEval-2016 (Task 5). Our system is built on linear binary classifiers for aspect category classification (Slot 1), lexicon-based detection of opinion target expres-sions (Slot 2), and linear multi-class classifi-ers for sentiment polarity detection (Slot 3). We conducted several different approaches for feature selection to improve classification performance on both Slot 1 and Slot 3. Our proposed methods are easily adaptable to all languages and domains since they are built as constrained systems which do not use any additional resources other than the provided datasets and which uses standard prepro-cessing methods.
