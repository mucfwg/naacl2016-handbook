A reputation system assists people selecting whom to trust. The ``all good reputation'' problem is common in e-commerce domain, making it difficult for buyers to choose cred- ible sellers. Observing high growth of on- line data in Hindi language, in this paper, we propose a reputation system in this language. The functions of this system include 1) review mining for different criteria of online transac- tions 2) calculation of reputation rating and reputation weight for each criteria from user reviews and 3) ranking sellers based on com- puted reputation score. Extensive simulations conducted on eBay dataset show its effective- ness in solving ``all good reputation'' problem. So far as our knowledge is concerned, this is the first work in Hindi language on reputation system.
