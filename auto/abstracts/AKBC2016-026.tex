Recognition and disambiguation of named entities in text is a knowledge-intensive  task. Systems are typically bound by the resources and coverage of a single target knowledge base. In place of a fixed knowledge base (KB), we attempt to infer a set of endpoints which reliably disambiguate entity mentions on the web. We  propose a method for discovering web KBs and our preliminary results suggest that web KBs allow linking to entities that can be found on the web, but may not merit a major KB entry.
