This work presents a novel approach for automatic creation of sentiment word lists. In this approach, words are first mapped into a continuous latent space, which serves as input to a multilayer perceptron (MLP) trained using sentiment-annotated words. When evaluated using manually annotated EmoLex corpus, our approach compares favourably with SentiWordNet 3.0, another automatically generated word list.
