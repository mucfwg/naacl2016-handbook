We describe our submission system to the SemEval-2016 Task 8 on Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) Parsing. We attempt to improve AMR parsing by exploiting prepo- sition semantic role labeling information re- trieved from a multi-layer feed-forward neu- ral network. Prepositional semantics is in- cluded as features into the transition-based AMR parsing system CAMR (Wang, Xue, and S. Pradhan 2015a). The inclusion of the fea- tures modifies the behavior of CAMR when creating meaning representations triggered by prepositional semantics. Despite the useful- ness of preposition semantic role labeling in- formation for AMR parsing, it does not have an impact to the parsing F-score of CAMR, but reduces the parsing recall by 1\%.
