The complex word identification task refers to the process of identifying difficult words in a sentence from the perspective of readers belonging to a specific target audience. This task has immense importance in the field of lexical simplification. Lexical simplification helps in improving the readability of texts consisting of challenging words. As a participant of the SemEval-2016: Task 11 shared task, we developed two systems using various lexical and semantic features to identify complex words, one using Naive Bayes and another based on Random Forest Classifiers. The Naive Bayes classifier based system achieves the maximum G-score of 76.7\% after incorporating rule based post-processing techniques.
