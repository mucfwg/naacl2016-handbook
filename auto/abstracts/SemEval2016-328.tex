This is a system description paper for a submission to Task 8 of SemEval-2016: Meaning Representation Parsing.  No use was made of the training data provided by the task.  Instead existing components were combined to form a pipeline able to take raw sentences as input and output meaning representations.  Components are a part-of-speech tagger and parser trained on the Penn Parsed Corpus of Modern British English to produce syntactic parse trees, a semantic role labeller and a named entity recogniser to supplement obtained parse trees with word sense, functional and named entity information, followed by an adapted Tarskian satisfaction relation for a Dynamic Semantics that is used to transform a syntactic parse into a predicate logic based meaning representation, followed by conversion to penman notation required for the task appraisal.
