We introduce a new method for incremental shift-reduce parsing of discontinuous constituency trees, based on the fact that discontinuous trees can be transformed into continuous trees by changing the order of the terminal nodes. It allows for a clean formulation of different oracles, leads to faster parsers and provides better results. Our best system achieves an F1 of 80.02 on TIGER.
