The 2016 ACL Workshop on Computational Linguistics and Clinical Psychology (CLPsych) included a shared task focusing on classification of posts to ReachOut, an online information and support service that provides help to teens and young adults (aged 15-24) who are struggling with mental health issues. The primary goal of the shared task is to identify posts that require urgent attention and review from the ReachOut team (i.e.moderators). GW/UMD best official submission yielded 0:36\% macro-F1, which is 6\% short of the best system. However, further feature experimentation after the conclusion of the shared task yielded a macro F1 score of 0:45\%.
