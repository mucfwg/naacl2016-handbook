We present improvements to the JAMR parser as part of the SemEval 2016 Shared Task 8 on AMR parsing. The major contributions are: improved concept coverage using external resources and features, an improved aligner, and a novel loss function for structured prediction called infinite ramp, which is a generalization of the structured SVM to problems with unreachable training instances.
