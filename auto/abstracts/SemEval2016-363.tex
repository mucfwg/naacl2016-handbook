We report the findings of the Complex Word Identification task of SemEval 2016. To create a dataset, we conduct a user study with 400 non-native English speakers, and find that complex words tend to be rarer, less ambiguous and shorter. A total of 42 systems were submitted from 21 distinct teams, and nine baselines were provided. The results highlight the effectiveness of Decision Trees and Ensemble methods for the task, but ultimately reveal that word frequencies remain the most reliable predictor of word complexity.
