The paper presents Bulgarian discontinuous constituents. Bulgarian is claimed to be a language of relatively free word order. As a typical manifestation of free word order discontinuous constituents in Bulgarian have not been studied so far. The paper discusses and analyzes the freedom in Bulgarian word order and points out the way discontinuity has been treated within Bultreebank. We show the results of our linguistic analysis of discontinuous VPs and summarize the extent of word order freedom and word order constraints within VP.
