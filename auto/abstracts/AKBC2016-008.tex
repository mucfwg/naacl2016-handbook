We propose a general approach to modeling semi-supervised learning constraints on unlabeled data. Both traditional supervised classification tasks and many natural semi-supervised learning heuristics can be approximated by specifying the desired outcome of walks through a graph of classifiers. We demonstrate the modeling capability of this approach in the task of relation extraction, and experimental results show that the modeled constraints achieve better performance as expected.
