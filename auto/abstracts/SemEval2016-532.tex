Sentiment analysis of tweets has attracted considerable attentions recently for potential use in commercial and public sector applications. Typical sentiment analysis classifies the sentiment of sentences into several discrete classes (e.g., positive and negative). For Task 4 subtask C of SemEval-2016, the aim is to classify the sentiment of tweets into an ordinal five-point scale. In this paper, we presents a system that uses word embeddings and recurrent convolutional network for this competition. The word embeddings provide a continuous vector representation of words for the recurrent convolutional network to build sentence vectors for multi-point classification. The results show that the proposed method achieved the second rank among eleven teams for micro-averaged MAE (mean absolute error) and eighth rank for macro-averaged MAE.
