In spite of methodological and conceptual parallels, the computational linguistic applications short answer scoring (Burrows et al., 2015), authorship attribution (Stamatatos, 2009), and plagiarism detection (Zesch and Gurevych, 2012) haven't been linked in practice. This work explores the practical usefulness of the combination of features from each of these fields for two tasks: semantic learner language classification, and plagiarism detection. The experiments show that incorporating features from the other domain yields significant improvements. A feature analysis reveals that robust lexical and semantic features are most informative for these tasks.
