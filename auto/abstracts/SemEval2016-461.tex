This paper describes the system for rating the degree of semantic equivalence between two text snippets developed by team IHS-RD-Belarus for the SemEval 2016 STS shared task (Task 1). To predict the human ratings of text similarity we use a support vector regression model with multiple features representing similarity and difference scores calculated for each pair of sentences.
