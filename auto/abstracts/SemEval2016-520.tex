Minions, a team formed of first year students in the Master of Computational Linguistics, started the participation at SemEval-2016 as a semester project, aiming to build a model for analyzing and classifying ``tweets'' into positive, neutral and negative, according to the evoked sentiment, while getting familiar with Natural Language Processing tools and methods. Therefore, the backbone of our sentiment analyzer consists in several off-the-shelf, freely available resources, enhanced with a classifier trained on the SemEval-2016 data.
