In recent years there have been many knowledge bases (KBs) constructed yet there is not yet a verb resource that maps to these growing KB resources. A resource that contains verbs in different languages to identify KB relations will be useful for extracting more facts to the KBs from any language text and to aid alignment and integration of knowledge across different KBs and languages. Such multi-lingual verb resource can also be useful for tasks such as machine reading and machine translation. In this paper, we present a scalable approach to automatically construct such verb resource using a very large web text corpus as a kind of interlingua to relate verb phrases to KB relations. Given a text corpus in any language and any KB, it can produce a mapping of that language's verb phrases to the KB relations. Experiments with English NELL KB and ClueWeb corpus show that the learned English verb-to-relation mapping is effective for extracting relation instances from English text. Using the same method on a Portuguese NELL KB and a Portuguese text corpus, we are able to construct automatically a verb resource in Portuguese that is effective for extracting relation instances from Portuguese text.
