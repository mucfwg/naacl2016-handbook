In this paper, we introduce a typology of bridging relations applicable to multiple languages and genres. After discussing our annotation guidelines, we describe annotation experiments on the German part of our parallel coreference corpus and show that our inter-annotator agreement results are reliable, considering both antecedent selection and relation assignment. In order to validate our theoretical model on other languages, we manually transfer German annotations to the English and Russian sides of the corpus and briefly discuss first results that suggest the promise of our approach. Furthermore, for the complete exploration of extended coreference relations, we exploit an existing near-identity scheme to augment our annotations with near-identity links, and we report on the results.
