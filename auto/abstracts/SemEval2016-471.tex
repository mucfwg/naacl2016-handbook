In this paper, we describe the KULeuven-LIIR system at the Clinical TempEval 2016 Shared Task for the narrative container relation sub-task (CR). Our approach is based on the cTAKES Temporal system (Lin et al, 2015). We explored extending this system with different features. Moreover, we provide an error analysis of the submitted system, and report on some additional experiments done after submission.
