This paper will discuss and compare event representations across a variety of types of event annotation: Rich Entities, Relations, and Events (Rich ERE), Light Entities, Relations, and Events (Light ERE), Event Nugget (EN), Event Argument Extraction (EAE), Richer Event Descriptions (RED), and Event-Event Relations (EER).  Comparisons of event representations are presented, along with a comparison of data annotated according to each event representation.  An event annotation experiment is also discussed, including annotation for all of these representations on the same set of sample data, with the purpose of being able to compare actual annotation across all of these approaches as directly as possible. We walk through a brief example to illustrate the various annotation approaches, and to show the intersections among the various annotated data sets.
