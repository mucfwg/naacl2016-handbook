Coreference resolution is one of the first stages in deep language understanding and its importance has been well recognized in the natural language processing community. In this paper, we propose a generative, unsupervised ranking model for entity coreference resolution. Our unsupervised system achieves 58.44\% F1 score of the CoNLL metric on the English data from CoNLL-2012 shared task, outperforming the Stanford deterministic system, the winner of the CoNLL 2011 shared task, by 3.01\% absolute.
