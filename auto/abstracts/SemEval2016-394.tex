This paper presents the MacSaar system developed to identify complex words in English texts. MacSaar participated in the SemEval 2016 task 11: Complex Word Identification submitting two runs. The system is based on the assumption that complex words are likely to be less frequent and on average longer than words considered to be simple. We report results of 82.5\% accuracy and 27\% F-Score using a Random Forest Classifier. The best MacSaar submission was ranked 8th in terms of F-Measure among 45 entries.
