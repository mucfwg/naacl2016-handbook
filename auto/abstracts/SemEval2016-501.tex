This paper describes the SAARSHEFF systems that participated in the English Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) task in SemEval-2016. We extend the work on using machine translation (MT) metrics in the STS task by annotating the STS datasets with a variety of MT scores for each pair of text snippets in the STS datasets. We trained our systems using boosted tree ensembles and achieved competitive results that outperforms the median Pearson correlation scores from all participating systems.
