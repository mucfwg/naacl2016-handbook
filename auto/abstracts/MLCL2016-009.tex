This paper presents a data-driven, simple cluster-and-label approach using optimized count-based methods for word-level language identification for a large domain-specific multilingual diachronic corpus of periodicals published at least yearly between 1864 and 2014 in Switzerland. Our system requires no annotated data or training, only minimal human effort in evaluating and labeling 50 clusters for a corpus of almost 40 million tokens. Despite being unsupervised, our results show an accuracy that is comparable to the corpus annotations which result from an existing code switching algorithm and the combined usage of two supervised systems using character and byte n-gram models (Volk and Clematide, 2014).
