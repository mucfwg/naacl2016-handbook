This paper describes the SemEval-2016 Shared Task 9: \textit{Chinese semantic Dependency Parsing}. We extend the traditional tree-structured representation of Chinese sentence to directed acyclic graphs that can capture richer latent semantics, and the goal of this task is to identify such semantic structures from a corpus of Chinese sentences. We provide two distinguished corpora in the NEWS domain with 10,068 sentences and the TEXTBOOKS domain with 14,793 sentences respectively. We will first introduce the motivation for this task, and then present the task in detail including data preparation, data format, task evaluation and so on. At last, we briefly describe the submitted systems and analyze these results.
