This paper describes our system participating in the Semeval 2016 task: Detecting stance in Tweets. The goal was to identify whether the author of a tweet is in favor of the given target or against. Our approach is based on a maximum entropy classifier, which uses surface-level, sentiment and domain-specific features. We participated in both the supervised and weakly supervised subtasks and received promising results for most of the targets.
