In this paper we present our work on Coreference Resolution in Basque, a unique language which poses interesting challenges for the problem of coreference. We explain how we extend the coreference resolution toolkit, BART, in order to enable it to process Basque. Then we run four different experiments showing both a significant improvement by extending a baseline feature set and the effect of calculating performance of hand-parsed mentions vs. automatically parsed mentions. Finally, we discuss some key characteristics of Basque which make it particularly challenging for coreference and draw a road map for future work.
