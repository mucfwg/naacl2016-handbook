Complex word identification task focuses on identifying the difficult word from English sentence for a Non-Native speakers. Non-Native speakers are those who don't have English as their native language. It is a sub-task for lexical simplification. We have experimented with word embedding features, orthographic word features, similarity features and POS tag features which improves the performance of the classification. In addition to the SemEval 2016 results we have evaluated the training data by varying the vector dimension size and obtained the best possible size for producing better performance. The SVM learning algorithm will attains constant and maximum accuracy through linear classifier. We achieve a G-score of 0.43 and 0.54 on computing complex words for two systems.
