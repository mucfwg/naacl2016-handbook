This paper describes our systems submitted to the Sentence-level and Text-level Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) task (i.e., Task 5) in SemEval-2016. The task involves two phases, namely, Aspect Detection phase and Sentiment Polarity Classification phase. We participated in the second phase of both subtasks in laptop and restaurant domains, which focuses on the sentiment analysis based on the given aspect. In this task, we extracted four types of features (i.e., Sentiment Lexicon Features, Linguistic Features, Topic Model Features and Word2vec Feature) from certain fragments related to  aspect rather than the whole sentence. Then the proposed features are fed into supervised classifiers for sentiment analysis. Our submissions rank above average.
