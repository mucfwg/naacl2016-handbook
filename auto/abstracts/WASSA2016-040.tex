Does sharing moral values encourage people to connect and form communities? The importance of moral homophily (love of same) has been recognized by social scientists, but the types of moral similarities that drive this phenomenon are still unknown.

Our results indicate that social network processes reflect moral selection, and both online and offline differences in moral purity concerns are particularly predictive of social distance.
