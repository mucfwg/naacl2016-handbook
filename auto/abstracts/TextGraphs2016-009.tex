We present a tool for dynamic reference graph visualization. A reference graph is a graph based on key phrases retrieved from a time-indexed natural language text corpus. This tool may be useful for the analysis of connected pairs of latent topics, changes in the significance of these topics as well as in the relationship between them over various time periods.
