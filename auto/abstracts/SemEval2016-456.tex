This paper describes aspect-based polarity detection system for Russian, used in aspect-based sentiment analysis task (ABSA) of SemEval-2016 (Task 5, subtask 1, slot 3). The system consists of two independent classifiers: for opinion target expressions and for implicit opinion target mentions. We introduce a set of standard unigram features together with more sophisticated ones: based on sentence syntactic structure and based on lemmas vector representation. Being applied to Russian restaurant reviews, our system achieved best quality among four participants.
