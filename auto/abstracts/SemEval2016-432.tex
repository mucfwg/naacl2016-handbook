This paper describes the system that was submitted to SemEval2016 Task 11: Complex Word Identification. It presents a preliminary investigation into exploring word difficulty for non-native English speakers. We developed two systems using Nearest Centroid Classification technique to distinguish complex words from simple words. Optimized over G-score, the presented solution obtained a G-score of 0.67, while the winner achieved a G-score of 0.77 and the average G-score of all the submitted systems in the task was 0.56.
