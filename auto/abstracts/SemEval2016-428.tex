In this paper, we report an implementation of neural network based approaches for semantic textual similarity prediction. We leverage multi-layer bidirectional LSTM to learn sentence representation. Then we construct matching features followed by Highway Multilayer Perceptron to make predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach can't get better results on standard evaluation datasets.
