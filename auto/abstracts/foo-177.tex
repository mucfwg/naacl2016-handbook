Sequence labeling for extraction of medical events and their attributes from unstructured text in Electronic Health Record (EHR) notes is a key step towards semantic understanding of EHRs. It has important applications in health informatics including pharmacovigilance and drug surveillance. The state of the art supervised machine learning models in this domain are based on Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) with features calculated from fixed context windows. However, different types of medical events have dependencies in different context window sizes. In this application, we explored recurrent neural network frameworks and show that they significantly outperformed the CRF models. We analyze the performance of the RNN models and show that they can more efficiently discriminate between medical entities, using the same context size as the CRF models.
