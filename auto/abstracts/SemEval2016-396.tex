In this paper we describe the participation of the Joint Research Centre, EC, in task 14 - Semantic Taxonomy Enrichment at SemEval 2016. The algorithm which we propose transforms each candidate definition into a term vector, where each dimension represents a term and its value is calculated by TF.IDF. We attach the candidate term as a hyponym to the WordNet synset with the most similar definition. The results we obtained are encouraging, considering the simplicity of our approach. The obtained F measure is  below the average, but above one of the baselines. \end{abstract}
