The paper presents the system developed by the SentimentalITsts team for the participation in SemEval-2016 task 4, in the subtasks A, B and C. The developed system uses off the shelf solutions for the development of a quick sentiment analyzer for tweets. However, the lack of any syntactic or semantic information resulted in performances lower than those of other teams.
