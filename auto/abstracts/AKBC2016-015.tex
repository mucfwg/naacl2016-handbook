We present a design for acquiring word association knowledge of high quality on the basis of a game with a purpose (GWAP). We evaluate automatically acquired word associations using a word association game as a GWAP. In the word association game, a player is given a set of associated words as a hint and is asked to answer a word that can be associated with the hint. If many players can answer the correct keyword, we judge the set of associated words to be of high quality. This word association game was implemented in a smartphone-based dialog system, which has been installed into more than one million smartphones. Our analysis of numerous game logs demonstrated that our framework can effectively select word associations of high quality.
