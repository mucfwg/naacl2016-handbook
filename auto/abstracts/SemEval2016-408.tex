VRep is a system designed for SemEval 2016 Task 1 - Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) and Task 2 - Interpretable Semantic Textual Similarity (iSTS). STS quantifies the semantic equivalence between two snippets of text, and iSTS provides a reason why those snippets of text are similar. VRep makes extensive use of WordNet for both STS, where the Vector relatedness measure is used, and for iSTS, where features are extracted to create a learned rule-based classifier. This paper outlines the VRep algorithm, provides results from the 2016 SemEval competition, and analyzes the performance contributions of the system components.
