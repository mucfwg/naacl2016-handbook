Manually constructed taxonomies provide a crucial resource for many NLP technologies, yet these resources are often limited in their lexical coverage due to their construction procedure. While multiple approaches have been proposed to enrich such taxonomies with new concepts, these techniques are typically evaluated by measuring the accuracy at identifying relationships between words, e.g., that a dog is a canine, rather relationships between specific concepts. Task 14 provides an evaluation framework for automatic taxonomy enrichment techniques by measuring the placement of a new concept into an existing taxonomy: Given a new word and its definition, systems were asked to attach or merge the concept into an existing WordNet concept. Five teams submitted 13 systems to the task, all of which were able to improve over the random baseline system. However, only one participating system outperformed the second, more-competitive baseline that attaches a new term to the first word in its gloss with the appropriate part of speech, which indicates that techniques must be adapted to exploit the structure of glosses.
