This paper describes our IR (Information Retrieval) based method for Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) in the SemEval 2016 task 1. The main feature of our approach is to extend a conventional IR-based scheme by incorporating word alignment results. This enables us to develop a more fine-grained similarity measurement. In the evaluation results, we have seen that the proposed method improves upon a conventional IR-based method on average. In addition, one of our submissions achieved the best performance for the ``postediting'' data set.
