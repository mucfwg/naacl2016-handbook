When automatically detecting deception, it is important to model individual differences across speakers.  We explore the automatic identification of individual traits such as gender, native language, and personality, using acoustic-prosodic and lexical features from an initial non-deceptive dialogue. We also explore predicting success at deception and at deception detection, using the same features.
