In this paper, we describe the system developed for our participation in the Clinical TempEval task of SemEval 2016 (task 12). Our team focused on the subtasks of span and attribute identification and proposed a system that integrates both statistical and linguistic approaches. Our system is based on Conditional Random Fields with high-precision linguistic features.
