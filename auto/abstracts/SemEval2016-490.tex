The 2016 Clinical TempEval challenge addresses temporal information extraction from clinical notes. The challenge is composed of six sub-tasks, each of which is to identify: (1) event mention spans, (2) time expression spans, (3) event attributes, (4) time attributes, (5) events' temporal relations to the document creation times (DocTimeRel), and (6) narrative container relations among events and times. In this article, we present an end-to-end system that addresses all six sub-tasks. Our system achieved the best performance for all six sub-tasks when plain texts were given as input. It also performed best for narrative container relation identification when gold standard event/time annotations were given.
