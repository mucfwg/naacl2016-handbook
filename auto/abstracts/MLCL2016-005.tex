In this paper, we propose to analyze the pre- and post-processing steps applied in the context of cross-lingual dependency transfer. To this aim, we employ a simple transfer strategy that operates on partially annotated projected data. We show that a good data selection strategy is a key point in successfully transferring dependencies and that better data selection techniques need to be developed in order to achieve the performance of fully supervised methods.
