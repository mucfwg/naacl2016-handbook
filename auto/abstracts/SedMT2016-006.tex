In this paper, we propose a graph-based translation model which takes advantage of discontinuous phrases. The model segments a graph which combines bigram and dependency relations into subgraphs and produces translations by combining translations of these subgraphs. Experiments on Chinese--English and German--English tasks show that our system is significantly better than the phrase-based model. By explicitly modeling the graph segmentation, our system gains further improvement.
