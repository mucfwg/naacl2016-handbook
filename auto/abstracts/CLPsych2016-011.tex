As self-directed online anxiety treatment and e-mental health programs become more prevalent and begin to rapidly scale to a large number of users, the need to develop automated techniques for monitoring patient progress and detecting early warning signs is at an all-time high. While current online therapy systems work based on explicit quantitative feedback from various survey measures, little attention has been paid thus far to the large amount of unstructured free text present in the monitoring logs and journals submitted by patients as part of the treatment process. In this paper, we automatically categorize patients' internal sentiment and emotions using machine learning classifiers based on n-grams, syntactic patterns, sentiment lexicon features, and distributed word embeddings. We report classification metrics on a novel mental health dataset.
