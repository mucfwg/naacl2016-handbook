This paper presents the description of a system which detects complex words. It solely uses information regarding the presence of a word in a prepared vocabulary list. The system outperforms multiple more advanced systems and is ranked fourth for the shared task, with minimal loss to the best system. F-score optimization guaranteed the first place in this measurement. Different features are considered and evaluated. Maximal bounds are predicted. The rule ``the simplest methods give the best results'' is confirmed.
