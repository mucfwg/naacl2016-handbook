We address the task of annotating images with semantic tuples. Solving this problem requires an algorithm able to deal with hundreds of classes for each argument of the tuple. In such contexts, data sparsity becomes a key challenge. We propose handling this by incorporating feature representations of both the inputs (images) and outputs (argument classes) into a factorized log-linear model.
