The 2016 Clinical TempEval continued the 2015 shared task on temporal information extraction with a new evaluation  test set. Our team, UtahBMI,  participated in all subtasks using machine learning approaches with ClearTK (LIBLINEAR), CRF++ and CRFsuite packages. Our experiments show that CRF-based classifiers yield, in general, higher recall for multi-word spans, while SVM-based classifiers are better at predicting correct attributes of TIMEX3. In addition, we show that an ensemble-based approach for TIMEX3 could yield improved results. Our team achieved competitive results in each subtask with an  F1 75.4\% for TIMEX3, F1 89.2\% for EVENT, F1 84.4\% for event relations with document time (DocTimeRel), and F1 51.1\% for narrative container (CONTAINS) relations.
