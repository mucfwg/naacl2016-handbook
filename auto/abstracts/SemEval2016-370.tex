The paper describes experiments on sentiment classification of microblog messages using an architecture allowing general machine learning classifiers to be combined either sequentially to form a multi-step classifier, or in parallel, creating an ensemble classifier. The system achieved very competitive results in the shared task on sentiment analysis in Twitter, in particular on non-Twitter social media data, that is, input it was not specifically tailored to.
