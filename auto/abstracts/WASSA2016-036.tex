Sentences and tweets are often annotated for sentiment simply by asking respondents to label them as positive, negative, or neutral. This works well for simple expressions of sentiment; however, for many other types of sentences, respondents are unsure of how to annotate, and produce inconsistent labels. In this paper, we outline several types of sentences that are particularly challenging for manual sentiment annotation. Next we propose two annotation schemes that address these challenges, and list benefits and limitations for both.
