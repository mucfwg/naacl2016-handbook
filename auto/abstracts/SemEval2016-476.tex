This paper describes our sentiment analysis system which has been built for Sentiment Analysis in Twitter Task of SemEval-2016. We have used a Logistic Regression classifier with different groups of features. This system is an improvement to our previous system Lsislif  in Semeval-2015 after removing some features and adding  new features extracted from a new automatic constructed sentiment lexicon.
