We present a multi-feature system for computing the semantic similarity between two sentences. We introduce the use of soft alignment for computing text similarity, and evaluate also different methods to produce it. The main features used by our system are based on soft and hard alignment between the sentences, and Explicit Semantic Analysis. Our system stood above the median scores for 4 out of the 5 datasets at SemEval 2016 STS Task 1.
