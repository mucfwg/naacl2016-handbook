This paper describes our system submitted for the Sentiment Analysis in Twitter task of SemEval-2016, and specifically for the Message Polarity Classification subtask. We used a system that combines Convolutional Neural Network and Logistic Regression for sentiment prediction, where the former makes use of embedding features while the later utilizes various features like lexicons and dictionaries.
