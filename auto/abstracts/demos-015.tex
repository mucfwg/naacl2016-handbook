This paper introduces Linguistica 5, a software for unsupervised learning of linguistic structure. It is a descendant of Goldsmith's (2001, 2006) Linguistica. Open-source and written in Python, the new Linguistica 5 is both a graphical user interface software and a Python library. While Linguistica 5 inherits its predecessors' strength in unsupervised learning of natural language morphology, it incorporates significant improvements in multiple ways. Notable new features include tools for data visualization as well as straightforward extensions for both its components and embedding in other programs.
