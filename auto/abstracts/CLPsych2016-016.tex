The 2016 CLPsych Shared Task was to automatically triage posts from a mental health forum into four categories:  ``green'' (everything is fine), ``amber'' (a moderator needs to look at this post), ``red'' (a moderator urgently needs to look at this post) and ``crisis'' (the person might hurt himself or others). The final results for the task revealed that this problem was not an easy task. I chose to treat the problem as a text categorization task using a system composed of different Support Vector Machines (SVMs) in a one-vs-rest setting. This approach was straight-forward and achieved good performance in the final evaluation. The major difficulty was to find suitable features and feature combinations.
