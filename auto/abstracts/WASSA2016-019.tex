For aspect-level sentiment analysis, the important first step is to identify the aspects and their associated entities from customer reviews. Aspects can be either explicit or implicit, where the identification of the latter is more difficult. For restaurant reviews, this difficulty is escalated due to the vast number of entities and aspects present in reviews. The existing work for implicit aspect identification in restaurant reviews has the limitation of choosing at most one implicit aspect for each sentence. Furthermore, they deal with only a limited set of aspects related to restaurant reviews. This paper presents a novel approach for implicit aspect detection, which overcomes these two limitations. Our approach yields an F1-measure of 0.842 for a set of restaurant reviews collected from Yelp.
