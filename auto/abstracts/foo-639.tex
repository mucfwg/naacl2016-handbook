We introduce the first dataset for sequential vision-to-language, and explore how this data may be used for the task of visual storytelling. The dataset includes 81,743 unique photos in 20,211 sequences, aligned to descriptive and story language. We establish several strong baselines for the storytelling task, and motivate an automatic metric to benchmark progress. We argue that modelling figurative and social language, as provided for in this data and the storytelling task, has the potential to move artificial intelligence from basic understandings of typical visual scenes towards more and more human-like understanding of grounded event structure and subjective expression.
