Despite the clear inter-dependency between analyzing the interactions in social networks, and analyzing the natural language content of these interactions, these aspects are typically studied independently. In this paper we present a first step towards finding a joint representation, by embedding  the two aspects into a single vector space. We show that the new representation can help improve performance in two social relations prediction tasks.
