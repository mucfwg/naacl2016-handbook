This paper describes in detail the approach carried out by the GTI research group for SemEval 2016 Task 5: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis, for the different subtasks proposed, as well as languages and dataset contexts. In particular, we developed a system for category detection based on SVM, for opinion target detection based on CRFs, for restaurants domain in English and Spanish languages, and for aspect-based sentiment analysis, with an unsupervised approach based on lexicons and syntactic dependencies, in English language for laptops and restaurants domains.
