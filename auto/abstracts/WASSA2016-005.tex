This paper analyzes the suitability of the standard naïve Bayes classifier for approaching the early classification problem, that is, determining the category of a document by using partial information only. Specifically, we assess its performance when classifying documents after seeing  an increasingly number of terms. A modification to the standard naïve Bayes allows us to make predictions with partial information. To the best of our knowledge Naïve Bayes has not been used for this purpose before. Throughout an extensive experimental evaluation we show the effectiveness of the classifier for early text classification. We also show that this simple solution is very competitive when compared with state of the art methodologies that are more elaborated.
