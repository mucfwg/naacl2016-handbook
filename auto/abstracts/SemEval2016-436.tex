This paper describes our participation in the SemEval-2016 Task 1: Semantic Textual Similarity (STS). We developed three methods for the English subtask (STS Core). The first method is unsupervised and uses WordNet and word2vec to measure a token-based overlap. In our second approach, we train a neural network on two features. The third method uses word2vec and LDA with regression splines.
