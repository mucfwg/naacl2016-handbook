The paper attempts at presenting initial verification of existing approaches to annotation of bridging relations by proposing a compiled model based on schemata used in previous annotation projects and testing its validity on a corpus of Polish. The categorization features structural relations, dissimilation, analogy, reference to label, class, entailment and attribution. Multiple categories can be assigned to model situations where several aspects of the relation play a part. The relations are organized hierarchically which allows varied granularity of processing depending on computational needs. The classification is confronted with existing annotation of other-than-identity relations in a portion of Polish Coreference Corpus. Results of manual annotation involving two annotators and adjudicator are presented. Findings from the process are intended to facilitate development of annotation guidelines of a new reference-related project.
