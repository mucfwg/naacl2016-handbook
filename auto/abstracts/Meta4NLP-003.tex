Some metaphorical mappings between source and target are obvious and appear in collocation patterns in natural language data. However, other metaphors that structure abstract processes or complex topics are trickier to investigate because the target domain is lexically divorced from the source.  Using metaphors for the economy as a case study, this paper introduces new techniques to find metaphorical tokens when target and source relationships are nonobvious. Through novel methods, constellations of source-domain triggers are identified in the data and evaluated for metaphoricity and keyness and then grouped according to trigger potency.
