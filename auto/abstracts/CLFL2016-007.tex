Film scripts provide a means of examining generalized western social perceptions of accepted human behavior. In particular, we focus on how dialogue in films describes gender, identifying linguistic and structural differences in speech for men and women and in same and different-gendered pairs. Using the Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus, we identify significant linguistic and structural features of dialogue that differentiate genders in conversation and analyze how those effects relate to existing literature on gender in film.
