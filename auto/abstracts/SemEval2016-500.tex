The final goal of Interpretable Semantic Textual Similarity (iSTS) is to build systems that explain which are the differences and commonalities between two sentences. The task adds an explanatory level on top of STS, formalized as an alignment between the chunks in the two input sentences, indicating the relation and similarity score of each alignment. The task provides train and test data on three datasets: news headlines, image captions and student answers. It attracted nine teams, totaling 20 runs. All datasets and the annotation guideline are freely available.
