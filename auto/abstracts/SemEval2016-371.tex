This paper describes the system deployed by the CLaC-EDLK team to the SemEval 2016, Complex Word Identification task. The goal is to identify if a given word in a given context is simple or complex. Our system relies on linguistic features and cognitive complexity. We used several supervised models; however the Random Forest model outperformed the others. Overall we achieved a performance of 68.8\% in the task, ranking us 21 out of 45 systems.
