The paper describes the submission to the task on Sentiment Analysis on Twitter at SemEval 2016. The approach is based on a Deep Learn-ing architecture using convolutional neural networks. The approach used word embed-dings as only features. The submission used embeddings created from a corpus of news ar-ticles. We report on further experiments using embeddings built for a corpus of tweets as weel as sentiment specific word embeddings obtained by distant supervision.
