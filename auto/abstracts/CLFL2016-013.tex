This paper proposes a technique to create figurative  relationships  using Mikolov  et  al.'s word vectors.  Drawing on existing work on figurative language,  we  start  with  a  pair  of words and use the intersection of word vector similarity  sets  to  blend  the  distinct  semantic spaces of the two words. We conduct preliminary quantitative and qualitative observations to compare the use of this novel intersection method with the standard word vector addition method for the purpose of supporting the generation of figurative language.
