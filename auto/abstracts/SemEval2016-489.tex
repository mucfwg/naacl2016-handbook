This paper describes our system for aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA). We participate in Subtask 1 (sentence-level ABSA), focusing specifically on aspect category detection. We train a binary classifier for each category. This year's addition of multiple languages makes language-independent approaches attractive. We propose to utilize neural networks which should be capable of discovering linguistic patterns in the data automatically, thereby reducing the need for language-specific tools and feature engineering.
