In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to sentiment polarity classification, which integrates data about the authors' reputation. More specifically, our method extends the h-index with citation polarities and utilize it in sentiment classification of citation sentences. Our computational results show that our method yields significant improvement in terms of classification performance.
