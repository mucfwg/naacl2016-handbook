We participate in the English subtask B and C at SemEval-2016 Task 3 ``Community Question Answering''. This paper is concerned with the description of our participating system. We propose a ranking model that combines a translation model with the cosine similarity-based method. Compared to the traditional bag of words method, the proposed model is more effective because the relationships between words can be explicitly modeled through word-to-word translation probabilities. Experiments conducted on the official test data demonstrate that our proposed ranking method obtains promising results.
