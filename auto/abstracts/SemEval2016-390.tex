This paper describes team MAZA entries for the 2016 SemEval Task 11: Complex Word Identification (CWI). The task is a binary classification task in which systems are trained to predict whether a word in a sentence is considered to be complex or not. We developed our two systems for this task based on classifier stacking using decision stumps and decision trees. Our best system, using contextual features, frequency information, and word and sentence length, achieved 91.2\% accuracy and 30.8\% F-Score. The system ranked 4th among the 38 entries in the CWI task in terms of F-Score.
