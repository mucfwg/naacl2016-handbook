We describe a set of systems submitted to the SemEval-2016 English Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) task. Given two English sentences, the task is to compute the degree of their semantic similarity. Each of our systems uses the SemEval 2012--2015 STS datasets to train a ridge regression model that combines different measures of similarity. Our best system demonstrates 73.6\% correlation with average human annotations across five test sets.
