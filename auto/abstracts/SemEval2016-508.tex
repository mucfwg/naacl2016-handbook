This paper describes the WOLVESAAR systems that participated in the English Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) task in SemEval-2016. We replicated the top systems from the last two editions of the STS task and extended the model using GloVe word embeddings and dense vector space LSTM based sentence representations. We compared the difference in performance of the replicated system and the extended variants. Our variants to the replicated system show improved correlation scores and all of our submissions outperform the median scores from all participating systems
