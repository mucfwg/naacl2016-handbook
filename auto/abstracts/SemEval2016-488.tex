This paper describes the system developed at LIF for the SemEval-2016 Task 4 evaluation campaign. The goal of the task was to identify sentiment polarity in tweets. The system extends the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) state of the art approach. We initialize the input representations with embeddings trained on different units: lexical, joint lexical and part-of-speech, and joint lexical and emoticon embeddings. Neural networks for each input space are trained separately, and then the representations extracted from their hidden layers are concatenated as input of a fusion neural network. The fusion system ranked 2nd at the SemEval-2016 evaluation campaign and obtained an average F1 of 63.0\%.
