We introduce the SV000gg systems: two Ensemble Methods for the Complex Word Identification task of SemEval 2016. While the SV000gg-Hard system exploits basic Hard Voting, the SV000gg-Soft system employs Performance-Oriented Soft Voting, which weights votes according to the voter's performance rather than its prediction confidence, allowing for completely heterogeneous systems to be combined. Our performance comparison shows that our voting techniques outperform traditional Soft Voting, as well as other systems submitted to the shared task, ranking first and second overall.
