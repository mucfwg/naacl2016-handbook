This paper describes an automatic tag assignment algorithm for various e commerce products where tag allotment is done solely based on the visual features in the image. It then builds a tag based product retrieval system using the allotted tags. The explosive growth of e-commerce products being sold online has made manual annotation infeasible. Without such tagging it is very hard for customers to search and find these products. Hence a scalable approach catering to a large number of product images and allocating meaningful tags is essential. This will also eliminate the need for the laborious process of manually tagging such products. It can be the basis of an efficient tag based product retrieval system. In this paper we propose one such approach based on feature extraction using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks to learn descriptive semantic features from product images. Then we use inverse distance weighted K-nearest neighbours classifiers together with several other multi-label classification approaches to assign appropriate tags to the images. We demonstrate the functioning of our algorithm for the Amazon product dataset for various categories of products like clothing and apparel, electronics, sports equipment etc.
