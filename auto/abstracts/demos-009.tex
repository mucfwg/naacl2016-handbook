We present the design and evaluation of a web-based peer review system that uses natural language processing to automatically evaluate and provide instant feedback regarding the presence of solutions in peer reviews. Student reviewers can then choose to either revise their reviews to address the system's feedback, or ignore the feedback and submit their original reviews. A system deployment in multiple high school classrooms shows that our solution prediction model triggers instant feedback with high precision, and that the feedback is successful in increasing the number of peer reviews with solutions.
