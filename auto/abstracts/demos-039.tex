Despite widespread adoption in NLP, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust in a model. Trust is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether or not to deploy a new model. In this work, we describe LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner. We further present a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant manner. We propose a demonstration of these ideas on different NLP tasks such as document classification, politeness detection, and twitter sentiment analysis, with classifiers like neural networks and SVMs. The user interactions include explanations of free-form text, challenging users to identify the better classifier from a pair, and perform basic feature engineering to improve the classifiers.
