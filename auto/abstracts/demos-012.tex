In this paper, we present Farasa, a fast and accurate Arabic segmenter. Our approach is based on SVM-rank using linear kernels. We measure the performance of the segmenter in terms of accuracy and efficiency, in two NLP tasks, namely Machine Translation (MT) and Information Retrieval (IR). Farasa outperforms or equalizes state-of-the-art Arabic segmenters (Stanford and MADAMIRA), while being more than one order of magnitude faster.
