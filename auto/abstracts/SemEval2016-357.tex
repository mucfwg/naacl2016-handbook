This paper describes an information-theoretic approach to complex word identification using a classifier based on an entropy based measure based on word senses and sentence-level perplexity features. We describe the motivation behind these features based on information density and demonstrate that they perform modestly well in the complex word identification task in SemEval-2016. We also discuss the possible improvements that can be made to future work by exploring the subjectivity of word complexity and more robust evaluation metrics for the complex word identification task.
