This paper presents an overview of an LFG treatment of discontinuous nominal expressions involving modification, making the claim that cross-linguistically different types of discontinuity (i.e. in Warlpiri and English) should be captured by the same overall analysis, despite being licensed in different ways. LFG's separation of grammatical functions from phrase structural positions intuitively accounts for discontinuous expressions, and its use of glue semantics ensures that discontinuous and contiguous expressions receive the same semantic analysis.
