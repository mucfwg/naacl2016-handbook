This research puts forward two concepts, the Naming Sharing Structure (NSS) and the Naming-Telling clause (NT clause). By trans-forming linear text into a plane structure, we discovered five construction patterns of NT clause for the NSS. The constructions of NT clauses are order-preserving, non-transgressive, and syntactically well-formed. These features of NT clause can be explained from the point of view of cognition.
