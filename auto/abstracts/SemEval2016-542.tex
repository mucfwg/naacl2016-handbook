This document discusses SemEval-2016 Task 4 ``Sentiment Analysis in Twitter'', a continuation of SemEval-2013 Task 2, SemEval-2014 Task 9, and SemEval-2015 Task 10. SemEval-2016 Task 4 comprises five subtasks, three of which represent a significant departure from previous editions. The three new subtasks focus, individually or in combination, on two variants of the basic ``sentiment classification in Twitter'' task that had not been previously explored within SemEval. The first variant adopts a five-point scale, which confers an ordinal character to the classification task. The second variant focuses on the correct estimation of the prevalence of each class of interest, a task which has been called quantification in the supervised learning literature. In contrast, previous years' subtasks have focused on the correct labelling of individual tweets. The task attracted a total of 43 teams.
