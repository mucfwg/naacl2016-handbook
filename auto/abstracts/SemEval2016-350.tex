This paper describes our approach to the SemEval 2016 task 4, ``Sentiment Analysis in Twitter'', where we participated in subtask A. Our system relies on AlchemyAPI and Senti- WordNet to create 43 features based on which we select a feature subset as final represen- tation. Active Learning then filters out noisy tweets from the provided training set, leaving a smaller set of only 900 tweets which we use for training a Multinomial Naive Bayes classi- fier to predict the labels of the test set with an F1 score of 0.478.
