This paper presents a solution to Semeval 2016 Task 14 which asks for a system that is able to insert new lemmas into WordNet. Our system aims to do this by overlapping words in the definitions of the to-be-inserted lemma and all senses in WordNet. This paper includes the results of our system and also includes the baseline provided by Task 14, with our system scoring higher than the random baseline, and lower than the first word baseline.
