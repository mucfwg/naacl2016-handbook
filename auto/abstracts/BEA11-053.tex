This is a report on the methods used and results obtained by the UW-Stanford team for the Automated Evaluation of Scientific Writing (AESW) Shared Task 2016 on grammatical error detection.  This team developed a symbolic grammar-based system augmented with manually defined {\em mal-rules} to accommodate and identify instances of high-frequency grammatical errors.   System results were entered both for the probabilistic estimation track, where we ranked second, and for the boolean decision track, where we ranked fourth.
