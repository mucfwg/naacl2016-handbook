We present a supervised system that uses lexical, sentiment, semantic dictionaries and latent and frame semantic features to identify the stance of a tweeter towards an ideological target. We evaluate the performance of the proposed system on subtask A in SemEval-2016 Task 6: ``Detecting Stance in Tweets''. The system yields an average F-score of 63.6\% on the task's test set and has been ranked the 6th by the task organizers out of 19 judged systems.
