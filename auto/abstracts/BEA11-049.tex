In this work, we estimate the deterioration of NLP processing given an estimate of the amount and nature of grammatical errors in a text. From a corpus of essays written by English-language learners, we extract ungrammatical sentences, controlling the number and types of errors in each sentence. We focus on six categories of errors that are commonly made by English-language learners, and consider sentences containing one or more of these errors. To evaluate the effect of grammatical errors, we measure the deterioration of the ungrammatical dependency parses using the labeled F-score, an adaptation of the labeled attachment score. We find notable differences between the influence of individual error types on the dependency parse, as well as interactions between multiple errors.
