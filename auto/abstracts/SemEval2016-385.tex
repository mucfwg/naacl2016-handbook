This paper is a description of our system de-veloped for SemEval-2016 Task 9: Chinese Semantic Dependency Parsing. We have built a transition-based dependency parser with on-line reordering, which is not limited to a tree structure and can produce 99.7\% of the necessary dependencies while maintaining linear algorithm complexity. To improve parsing quality we used additional techniques such as pre- and post-processing of the dependency graph, bootstrapping and a rich feature set with additional semantic features.
