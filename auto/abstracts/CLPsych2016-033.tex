This paper introduces a new shared task for the text mining community, and a rare chance to collaborate around unredacted social media data. The task aims to directly support the moderators of a youth mental health forum. It asks participants to automatically triage posts into one of four severity labels: green, amber, red or crisis. The task attracted 60 submissions from 15 different teams. The best of these achieve scores well above baselines. Their approaches and results provide valuable insights to enable moderators of peer support forums to react quickly to the most urgent, concerning content.
