Given multiple corrupted versions of the same text, as is common with ancient manuscripts, we wish to reconstruct the original text from which the extant corrupted versions were copied (typically via latent intermediary versions). This is a challenge of cardinal importance in the humanities. We use a variant of expectation-maximization (EM), to solve this problem. We prove the efficacy of our method on both synthetic and real-world data.
