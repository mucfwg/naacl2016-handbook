We investigate how users of intelligent writing assistance tools deal with correct, incorrect, and incomplete feedback. To this end, we conduct an empirical user study around an L1 text revision task for German. Our participants should revise stylistic issues in two given texts using a novel web-based writing environment that highlights potential issues and provides corresponding feedback messages. In comparison to a control group, we find that precision plays a more important role than recall, which confirms previous findings for other languages, issue types, user groups, and experimental setups.
