In this paper, we propose a classifier for predicting message-level sentiments of English micro-blog messages from Twitter. Our method builds upon the convolutional sentence embedding approach proposed by (Severyn and Moschitti, 2015a; Severyn and Moschitti, 2015b). We leverage large amounts of data with distant supervision to train an ensemble of 2-layer convolutional neural networks whose predictions are combined using a random forest classifier. Our approach was evaluated on the datasets of the SemEval-2016 competition (Task 4) outperforming all other approaches for the Message Polarity Classification task.
