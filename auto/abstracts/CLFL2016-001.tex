Most of the work dealing with automatic story production is based on a generic architecture for text generation; however, the resulting stories still lack of a style that can be called literary. We believe that in order to automatically generate stories that could be compared with human authors, a specific methodology for fiction text generation should be defined. We also believe that it is essential for stories to produce the idea of originality to the reader. Our methodology proposes a corpus-based approach for generating stories that can be called creative and also hold a style similar to human fiction texts. We also show how these stories hold plausible syntax and coherence and are perceived as interesting by human evaluators.
