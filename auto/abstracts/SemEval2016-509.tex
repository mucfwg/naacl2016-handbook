We present the INESC-ID system for the 2016 edition of SemEval Twitter Sentiment Analy- sis shared task (subtask 4-A). The system was based on the Non-Linear Sub-space Embed- ding (NLSE) model developed for last year's competition. This model trains a projection of pre-trained embeddings into a small sub- space using the supervised data available. De- spite its simplicity, the system attained perfor- mances comparable to the best systems of last edition with no need for feature engineering. One limitation of this model was the assump- tion that a pre-trained embedding was avail- able for every word. In this paper, we investi- gated different strategies to overcome this lim- itation by exploiting character-level embed- dings and learning representations for out-of- embedding vocabulary words. The resulting approach outperforms our previous model by a relatively small margin, while still attaining strong results and a consistent good perfor- mance across all the evaluation datasets.
