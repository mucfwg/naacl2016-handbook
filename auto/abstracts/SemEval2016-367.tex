We describe our entry to  SemEval 2016 Task 10: Detecting Minimal Semantic Units and their Meanings.  Our approach uses a discriminative first-order sequence model similar to \newcite{schneider2015corpus}.  The chief novelty in our approach is a factorization of the labels into multiword expression and supersense labels, and restricting first-order dependencies within these two parts.                          Our submitted models achieved first place in the closed competition (CRF) and second place in the open competition (2-CRF).
