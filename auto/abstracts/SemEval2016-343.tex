This paper presents our contribution to the SemEval 2016 task 5: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis. We have addressed Subtask 1 for the restaurant domain, in English and French, which implies opinion target expression detection, aspect category and polarity classification. We describe the different components of the system, based on composite models combining sophisticated linguistic features with Machine Learning algorithms, and report the results obtained for both languages.
