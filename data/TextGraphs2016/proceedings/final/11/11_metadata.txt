Abstract#==#Despite the clear inter-dependency between analyzing the interactions in social
networks, and analyzing the natural language content of these interactions,
these aspects are typically studied independently. In this paper we present a
first step towards finding a joint representation, by embedding  the two
aspects into a single vector space. We show that the new representation can
help improve performance in two social relations prediction tasks.
