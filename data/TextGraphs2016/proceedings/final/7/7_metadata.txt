Abstract#==#We propose a simple graph-based method for word sense disambiguation (WSD)
where sense and context embeddings are constructed by applying the Skip-gram
method to random walks over the sense graph. We used this method to build a WSD
system for Swedish using the SALDO lexicon, and evaluated it on six different
annotated test sets. In all cases, our system was several orders of magnitude
faster than a state-of-the-art PageRank-based system, while outperforming a
random baseline soundly.
