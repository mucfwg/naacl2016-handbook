Abstract#==#With the advent of Big Data concept, a lot
of attention have been paid to structuring and
giving semantic to this data. Knowledge
bases like DBPedia play an important role to
achieve this goal. Question answering systems
are common approach to address expressivity
and usability of information extraction
from knowledge bases. Recent researchers focused
only on monolingual QA systems while
cross-lingual setting has still so many barriers.
In this paper, we introduce a new cross-lingual
approach using a unified semantic space
among languages. After keyword extraction,
entity linking and answer type detection, we
use cross-lingual semantic similarity to extract
the answer from knowledge base via relation
selection and type matching. We have evaluated
our approach on Persian and Spanish
which are typologically different languages.
Our experiments are on DBPedia. The results
are promising for both
