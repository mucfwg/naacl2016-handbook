Abstract#==#Language processing tools suffer from significant performance drops in social
media domain due to its continuously evolving language. Transforming
non-standard words into their standard forms has been studied as a step towards
proper processing of ill-formed texts. This work describes a normalization
system that considers contextual and lexical similarities between standard and
non-standard words for removing noise in texts. A bipartite graph that
represents contexts shared by words in a large unlabeled text corpus is
utilized for exploring normalization candidates via random walks. Input context
of a non-standard word in a given sentence is tailored in cases where a direct
match to shared contexts is not possible. The performance of the system was
evaluated on Turkish social media texts.
