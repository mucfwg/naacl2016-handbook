Abstract#==#We present a tool for dynamic reference graph visualization. A reference graph
is a graph based on key phrases retrieved from a time-indexed natural language
text corpus. This tool may be useful for the analysis of connected pairs of
latent topics, changes in the significance of these topics as well as in the
relationship between them over various time periods.
