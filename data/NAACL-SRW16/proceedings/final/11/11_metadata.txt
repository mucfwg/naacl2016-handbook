Abstract#==#Extractive summarization techniques typically aim to maximize the information
coverage of the summary with respect to the original corpus and report
accuracies in ROUGE scores. Automated text summarization techniques should
consider the dimensions of comprehensibility, coherence and readability. In the
current work, we identify the discourse structure which provides the context
for the creation of a sentence. We leverage the information from the structure
to frame a mono-
tone (non-decreasing) sub-modular scoring function for generating
comprehensible summaries. Our approach improves the overall quality of
comprehensibility of the summary in terms of human evaluation and gives
sufficient content coverage with comparable ROUGE score. We also formulate a
metric to measure summary comprehensibility in terms of Contextual Independence
of a sentence. The metric is shown to be representative of human judgement of
text comprehensibility.
