Abstract#==#The translation of patents or scientific papers is a key issue that should be
helped by the use of statistical machine translation (SMT). In this paper, we
propose a method to improve Chinese-Japanese patent SMT by pre-marking the
training corpus with aligned bilingual multi-word terms. We automatically
extract multi-word terms from monolingual corpora by combining statistical and
linguistic filtering methods. We use the sampling-based alignment method to
identify aligned terms and set some threshold on translation probabilities to
select the most promising bilingual multi-word terms. We pre-mark a
Chinese-Japanese training corpus with such selected aligned bilingual
multi-word terms. We obtain the performance of over 70% precision in bilingual
term extraction and a significant improvement of BLEU scores in our experiments
on a Chinese-Japanese patent parallel corpus.
