Abstract#==#We present an end-to-end method for learning verb-specific semantic frames with
feedforward neural network (FNN). Previous works in this area mainly adopt a
multi-step procedure including part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing and
so on. On the contrary, our method uses a FNN model that maps verb-specific
sentences directly to semantic frames. The simple model gets good results on
annotated data and has a good generalization ability. Finally we get 0.82
F-score on 63 verbs and 0.73 F-score on 407 verbs.
