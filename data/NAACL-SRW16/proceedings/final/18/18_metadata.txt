Abstract#==#Sindhi is an Indo-Aryan language spoken by more than 75 million native speakers
in the world.
Nevertheless, Sindhi is a resource-poor language in terms of the availability
of language technology tools and resources.
In this thesis, we discuss the challenges faced and steps taken for 
creating raw and annotated datasets, constructing NLP tools such as a POS
tagger,
a morphological analyser, creating a transliteration system without parallel
data
in an unsupervised fashion and developing a SMT system for Sindhi-Urdu and
adopting techniques for improving it.
