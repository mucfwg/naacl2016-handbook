Abstract#==#We examine if common machine learning techniques known to perform well in
coarse-grained emotion and sentiment classification can also be applied
successfully on a set of fine-grained emotion categories. We first describe the
grounded theory approach used to develop a corpus of 5,553 tweets manually
annotated with 28 emotion categories. From our preliminary experiments, we have
identified two machine learning algorithms that perform well in this emotion
classification task and demonstrated that it is feasible to train classifiers
to detect 28 emotion categories without a huge drop in performance compared to
coarser-grained classification schemes.
