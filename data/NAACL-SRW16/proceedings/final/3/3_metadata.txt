Abstract#==#Spammer detection on social network is a challenging problem. The rigid
anti-spam rules have resulted in emergence of "smart" spammers. They resemble
legitimate users who are difficult to identify. In this paper, we present a
novel spammer classification approach based on Latent Dirichlet
Allocation(LDA), a topic model. Our approach extracts both the local and the
global information of topic distribution patterns, which capture the essence of
spamming. Tested on one benchmark dataset and one self-collected dataset, our
proposed method outperforms other stateof-the-art methods in terms of averaged
F1-score.
