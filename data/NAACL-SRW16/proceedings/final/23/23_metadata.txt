Abstract#==#Following up on numerous reports of analogy-based identification of
``linguistic regularities" in word embeddings, this study applies the widely
used vector offset method to 4 types of linguistic relations: inflectional and
derivational morphology, and lexicographic and encyclopedic semantics. We
present a balanced test set with 99,200 questions in 40 categories, and we
systematically examine how accuracy for different categories is affected by
window size and dimensionality of the SVD-based word embeddings. We also show
that GloVe and SVD yield similar patterns of results for different categories,
offering further evidence for conceptual similarity between count-based and
neural-net based models.
