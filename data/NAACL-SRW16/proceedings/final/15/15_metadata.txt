Abstract#==#In this paper, we develop and evaluate several techniques for identifying
argumentative paragraphs in Chinese editorials. We first use three methods of
evaluation to score a paragraph's argumentative nature: a relative word
frequency approach; a method which targets known argumentative words in our
corpus; and a combined approach which uses elements from the previous two.
Then, we determine the best score thresholds for separating argumentative and
non-argumentative paragraphs. The results of our experimentation show that our
relative word frequency approach provides a reliable way to identify
argumentative paragraphs, though the inaccuracies in scoring invite improvement
through context-aware means.
