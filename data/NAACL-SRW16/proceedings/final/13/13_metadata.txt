Abstract#==#The success of many language modeling methods and applications relies heavily
on the amount of data available. This problem is further exacerbated in
statistical machine translation, where parallel data in the source and target
languages is required. However, large amounts of data are only available for a
small number of languages; as a result, many language modeling techniques are
inadequate for the vast majority of languages. In this paper, we attempt to
lessen the problem of a lack of training data for low-resource languages by
adding data from related high-resource languages in three experiments. First,
we interpolate language models trained on the target language and on the
related language. In our second experiment, we select the sentences most
similar to the target language and add them to our training corpus. Finally, we
integrate data from the related language into a translation model for a
statistical machine translation application. Although we do not see many
significant improvements over baselines trained on a small amount of data in
the target language, we discuss some further experiments that could be
attempted in order to augment language models and translation models with data
from related languages.
