Abstract#==#Hate speech in the form of racist and sexist remarks are a common occurrence on
social media. For that reason many social media services address the problem of
identifying hate speech, but the definition of hate speech varies markedly and
is largely manual effort. We provide a list of criteria founded in critical
race theory to annotate a publicly available corpus of more than 16k tweets,
and analyze the impact of various features in conjunction with character
n-grams, for detection of said hate speech. We also present the most indicative
words, and present a dictionary based on our data.
