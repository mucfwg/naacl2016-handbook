Abstract#==#This paper describes an automatic tag assignment algorithm for various e
commerce products where tag allotment is done solely based on the visual
features in the image. It then builds a tag based product retrieval system
using the allotted tags.
The explosive growth of e-commerce products being sold online has made manual
annotation infeasible. Without such tagging it is very hard for customers to
search and find these products. Hence a scalable approach catering
to a large number of product images and allocating meaningful tags is
essential. This will also eliminate the need for the laborious process of
manually tagging such products. It can be the basis of an efficient tag based
product retrieval system.
In this paper we propose one such approach based on feature extraction using
Deep Convolutional Neural Networks to learn descriptive semantic features from
product images. Then we use inverse distance weighted K-nearest neighbours
classifiers together with several other multi-label classification approaches
to assign appropriate tags to the images. We demonstrate the functioning of our
algorithm for the Amazon product dataset for various categories of products
like clothing and apparel, electronics, sports equipment etc.
