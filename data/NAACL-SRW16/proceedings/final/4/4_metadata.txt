Abstract#==#In the task of question answering, Memory
Networks have recently shown to be quite effective
towards complex reasoning as well as
scalability, in spite of limited range of topics
covered in training data. In this paper, we introduce Factual Memory
Network, which learns to answer questions by
extracting and reasoning over relevant facts
from a Knowledge Base. Our system generate
distributed representation of questions and
KB in same word vector space, extract a subset
of initial candidate facts, then try to find
a path to answer entity using multi-hop reasoning
and refinement. Additionally, we also
improve the run-time efficiency of our model
using various computational heuristics.
