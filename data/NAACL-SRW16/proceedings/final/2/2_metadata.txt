Abstract#==#We present here two methods for extraction o, meronymic relation : (a) the
first one relies solely on syntactic information. Unlike other approaches based
on simple patterns, we determine their optimal combination to extract word
pairs linked via a given semantic relation; (b) the second approach consists in
combining syntactic patterns with the semantic information extracted from the
Wikipedia hyperlink hierarchy (WHH) of the constituent words. By comparing our
work with SemEval 2007 (Task 4 test set) and WordNet (WN) we found that our
system clearly outperforms its competitors
