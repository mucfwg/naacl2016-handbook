Abstract#==#Computational phylogenetics has been shown to be effective over grammatical
characteristics. Recent work suggests that constraint-based formalisms are
compatible with such an approach (Eden, 2013). In this paper, we report on
simulations to determine how useful constraint-based formalisms are in
phylogenetic research and under what conditions.

Popular computational methods for phylogenetic research (estimating the
evolutionary histories of languages) primarily involve comparisons over cognate
sets (Nichols and Warnow, 2008).  Recent works (Dunn et al., 2005; Longobardi 
and Guardiano, 2009) indicate that comparing sets of grammatical parameters can
be effective as well.  However, generating a large number of meaningful
parameters remains a formal obstacle.  In this paper we argue that
constraint-based grammar formalisms may be exploited for parameter generation,
and explore to what extent such research is feasible.
