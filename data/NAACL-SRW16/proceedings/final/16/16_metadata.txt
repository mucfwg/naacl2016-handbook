Abstract#==#We conducted an Artificial Language Learning experiment to examine the
production behavior of language learners in a dynamic communicative setting.
Participants were exposed to a miniature language with two optional formal
devices and were then asked to use the acquired language to transfer
information in a cooperative game. The results showed that language learners
optimize their use of the optional formal devices to transfer information
efficiently and that they avoid the production of ambiguous information. These
results could be used within the context of a language model such that the
model can more accurately reflect the production behavior of human language
learners.
