Abstract#==#The elasticity of metaphor as a communication strategy has spurred philosophers
to question its ability to mean anything at all. If a metaphor can elicit
different responses from different people in varying contexts, how can one say
it has a single meaning? Davidson has argued that metaphors have no special or
secondary meaning, and must thus mean exactly what they seem to mean on the
surface. It is this literally anomalous meaning that directs us to the
pragmatic inferences that a speaker actually wishes us to explore.
Conveniently, this laissez faire strategy assumes that metaphors are crafted
from apt knowledge by speakers with real communicative intent, allowing useful
inference to be extracted from their words. But this assumption is not valid in
the case of many machine-generated metaphors that merely echo the linguistic
form – but lack the actual substance – of real metaphors. We present here
an open public resource with which a metaphor-generation system can give its
figurative efforts real meaning.
