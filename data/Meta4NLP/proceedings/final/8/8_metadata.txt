Abstract#==#Automatic metaphor detection usually relies on various features, incorporating
e.g. selectional preference violations or concreteness ratings to detect
metaphors in text. These features rely on background corpora, hand-coded rules
or additional, manually created resources, all specific to the language the
system is being used on.
We present a novel approach to metaphor detection using neural network in
combination with word embeddings, a method that has already proven to yield
promising results for other natural language processing tasks. We show that
foregoing manual feature engineering by solely relying on word embeddings
trained on large corpora produces comparable results to other systems, while
removing the need for additional resources.
