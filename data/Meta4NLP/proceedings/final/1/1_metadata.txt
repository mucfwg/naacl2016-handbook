Abstract#==#In this paper, we propose a novel approach for supervised classification of
linguistic metaphors in an open domain text using Conditional Random Fields
(CRF). We analyze CRF based classification model for metaphor detection using
syntactic, conceptual, affective, and word embeddings based features which
are extracted from MRC Psycholinguistic Database (MRCPD) and WordNet-Affect. We
use word embeddings given by Huang et al. to capture information such as
coherence and analogy between words. To tackle the bottleneck of limited
coverage of psychological features in MRCPD, we employ synonymy relations from
WordNet Â® . A comparison of our approach with previous approaches shows the
efficacy of CRF classifier in detecting metaphors. The experiments conducted on
VU Amsterdam metaphor corpus provides an accuracy of more than 92% and
F-measure of approximately 78%. Results shows that inclusion of conceptual
features improves the recall by 5% whereas affective features do not have any
major impact on metaphor detection in open text.
