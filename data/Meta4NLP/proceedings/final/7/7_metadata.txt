Abstract#==#Recent work on metaphor processing often employs selectional preference
information. We present a comparison of different approaches to the modelling
of selectional preferences, based on various ways of generalizing over corpus
frequencies. We evaluate on the VU Amsterdam Metaphor corpus, a broad corpus of
metaphor. We find that using only selectional preference information is not
enough to  outperform an all-metaphor baseline classification. A possible
explanation for this lies in the nature of the evaluation data, and lack of
power of selectional preference information on its own for non-novel metaphor
detection. To better investigate the role of metaphor type in metaphor
detection, we suggest a resource with annotation of novel metaphor should be
created.
