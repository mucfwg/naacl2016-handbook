Abstract#==#Some metaphorical mappings between source and target are obvious and appear in
collocation patterns in natural language data. However, other metaphors that
structure abstract processes or complex topics are trickier to investigate
because the target domain is lexically divorced from the source.  Using
metaphors for the economy as a case study, this paper introduces new techniques
to find metaphorical tokens when target and source relationships are
nonobvious. Through novel methods, constellations of source-domain triggers are
identified in the data and evaluated for metaphoricity and keyness and then
grouped according to trigger potency.
