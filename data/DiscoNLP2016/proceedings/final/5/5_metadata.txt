Abstract#==#Non-adjacent linguistic phenomena such as non-contiguous multiwords and other
phrasal units containing insertions, i.e., words that are not part of the unit,
are difficult to process and remain a problem for NLP applications.
Non-contiguous multiword units are common across languages and constitute some
of the most important challenges to high quality machine translation. This
paper presents an empirical analysis of non-contiguous multiwords, and
highlights our use of the Logos Model and the Semtab function to deploy
semantic knowledge to align non-contiguous multiword units with the goal to
translate these units with high fidelity. The phrase level manual alignments
illustrated in the paper were produced with the CLUE-Aligner, a Cross-Language
Unit Elicitation alignment tool.
