Abstract#==#This paper presents an overview of an LFG treatment of discontinuous nominal
expressions involving modification, making the claim that cross-linguistically
different types of discontinuity (i.e. in Warlpiri and English) should be
captured by the same overall analysis, despite being licensed in different
ways. LFG's separation of grammatical functions from phrase structural
positions intuitively accounts for discontinuous expressions, and its use of
glue semantics ensures that discontinuous and contiguous expressions receive
the same semantic analysis.
