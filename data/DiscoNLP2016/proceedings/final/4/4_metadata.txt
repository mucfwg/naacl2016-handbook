Abstract#==#We describe results of investigation of a specific type of discontinuous
constructions, namely non-projective constructions concerning verbs and their
arguments. This topic is especially important for languages with a relatively
free word order, such as Czech, which is the language we have primarily worked
with. For comparison, we have included some results for English. The corpora
used for both languages are the Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank and
the Prague Dependency Treebank, which are both annotated at a dependency syntax
level as well as a deep (semantic) level, including verbs and their valency
(arguments). We are using traditionally defined non-projectivity on trees with
full linear ordering, but the two levels of annotation are innovatively
combined to determine if a particular (deep) verb-argument structure is
non-projective. As a result, we have identified several types of
discontinuities, which we classify either by the verb class or structurally
in terms of the verb, its arguments and their dependents. In addition, we have
quantitatively compared selected phenomena found in Czech translated texts (in
the PCEDT) to the native Czech as found in the original Prague Dependency
Treebank.
