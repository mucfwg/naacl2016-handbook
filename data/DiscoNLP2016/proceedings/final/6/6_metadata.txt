Abstract#==#The paper presents Bulgarian discontinuous constituents. Bulgarian is claimed
to be a language of relatively free word order. As a typical manifestation of
free word order discontinuous constituents in Bulgarian have not been studied
so far. The paper discusses and analyzes the freedom in Bulgarian word order
and points out the way discontinuity has been treated within Bultreebank. We
show the results of our linguistic analysis of discontinuous VPs and summarize
the extent of word order freedom and word order constraints within VP.
