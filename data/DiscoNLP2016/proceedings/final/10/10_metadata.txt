Abstract#==#In this paper, we use insights from Minimalist Grammars
  (Keenan and Stabler, 2003) to argue for a context-free
  approximation of discontinuous structures that is both
  easy to parse for state-of-the-art dynamic programming
  constituent parsers and has a simple and effective
  method for the reconstruction of discontinuous tree structures.

  The results achieved on the Tiger treebank -- paired with
  state-of-the-art constituent parsers such as the BLLIP and Berkeley
  parsers -- both improve on existing transformation-based approaches
  for representing discontinuous structures and the state-of-the-art
  results of Fernandez-Gonzalez and Martins (2015)
