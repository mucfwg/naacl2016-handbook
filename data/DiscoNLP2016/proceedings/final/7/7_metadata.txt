Abstract#==#We introduce a new method for incremental shift-reduce parsing of discontinuous
constituency trees, based on the fact that discontinuous trees can be
transformed into continuous trees by changing the order of the terminal nodes.
It allows for a clean formulation of different oracles, leads to faster parsers
and provides better results. Our best system achieves an F1 of 80.02 on TIGER.
