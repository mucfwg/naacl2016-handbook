Abstract#==#This paper discusses genitive phrases in Hindi/Urdu in general and puts a
particular focus on genitive scrambling, a process whereby the basic order of
constituents is changed. In Hindi/Urdu, genitive phrases may not only occur at
different structural positions within the NP that they modify; under the right
circumstances, they can also be found outside of the NP, yielding discontinuous
structures. The theoretical challenge is to identify and formalize the
linguistic constraints that govern genitive scrambling. Further, a successful
computational treatment correctly attaches the genitive phrase to its head NP.
I use a Lexical-Functional Grammar to solve both challenges, demonstrating that
the constraints can be aptly formulated using a functional uncertainty path.
Successful attachment further depends on the morphological agreement of the
genitive phrase with its head. On a theoretical level, the present contribution
sheds light on the possibilities of NP discontinuities in a morphologically
rich language like Hindi/Urdu.
