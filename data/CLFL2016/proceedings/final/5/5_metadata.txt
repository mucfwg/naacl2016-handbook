Abstract#==#Given multiple corrupted versions of the same text, as is common with ancient
manuscripts, we wish to reconstruct the original text from which the extant
corrupted versions were copied (typically via latent intermediary versions).
This is a challenge of cardinal importance in the humanities. We use a variant
of expectation-maximization (EM), to solve this problem. We prove the efficacy
of our method on both synthetic and real-world data.
