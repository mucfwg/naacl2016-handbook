Abstract#==#Film scripts provide a means of examining generalized western social
perceptions of accepted human behavior. In particular, we focus on how
dialogue in films describes gender, identifying linguistic and structural
differences in speech for men and women and in same and different-gendered
pairs. Using the Cornell Movie-Dialogs Corpus, we identify significant
linguistic and structural features of dialogue that differentiate genders in
conversation and analyze how those effects relate to existing literature on
gender in film.
