Abstract#==#Following classical antiquity, European poetic meter was complicated by
traditions negotiating between the prosodic stress of vernacular dialects and a
classical system based on syllable length. Middle High German (MHG) epic poetry
found a solution in a hybrid qualitative and quantitative meter. We develop a
CRF model to predict the metrical values of syllables in MHG epic verse,
achieving an F-score of .894 on 10-fold cross-validated development data
(outperforming several baselines) and .904 on held-out testing data. The method
used in this paper presents itself as a viable option for other literary
traditions, and as a tool for subsequent genre or author analysis.
