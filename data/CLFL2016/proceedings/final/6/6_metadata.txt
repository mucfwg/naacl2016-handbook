Abstract#==#The chiasmus is a rhetorical figure involving
the repetition of a pair of words in reverse order, as in “all for one, one
for all”. Previous
work on detecting chiasmus in running text
has only considered superficial features like
words and punctuation. In this paper, we explore the use of syntactic features
as a means
to improve the quality of chiasmus detection.
Our results show that taking syntactic structure into account may increase
average precision from about 40 to 65% on texts taken from
European Parliament proceedings. To show
the generality of the approach, we also evaluate it on literary text and
observe a similar
improvement and a slightly better overall result.
