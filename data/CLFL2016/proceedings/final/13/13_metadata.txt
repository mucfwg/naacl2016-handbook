Abstract#==#This paper proposes a technique to create figurative  relationships  using 
Mikolov  et  al.â€™s word vectors.  Drawing on existing work on figurative 
language,  we  start  with  a  pair  of words and use the intersection of word
vector similarity  sets  to  blend  the  distinct  semantic spaces of the two
words. We conduct preliminary quantitative and qualitative observations to
compare the use of this novel intersection method with the standard word vector
addition method for the purpose of supporting the generation of figurative
language.
