Abstract#==#We present a novel task: the chronological classification of Hafez's poems
(ghazals). We compiled a bilingual corpus in digital form, with consistent
idiosyncratic properties. We have used Houman's labeled ghazals in order to
train automatic classifiers to classify the remaining ghazals. Our
classification framework uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with
similarity features based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). In our analysis
of the results we use the LDA topics' main terms that are passed on to a
Principal  Component Analysis (PCA) module.
