Abstract#==#Most of the work dealing with automatic story production is based on a generic
architecture for text generation; however, the resulting stories still lack of
a style that can be called literary. We believe that in order to automatically
generate stories that could be compared with human authors, a specific
methodology for fiction text generation should be defined. We also believe that
it is essential for stories to produce the idea of originality to the reader.
Our methodology proposes a corpus-based approach for generating stories that
can be called creative and also hold a style similar to human fiction texts. We
also show how these stories hold plausible syntax and coherence and are
perceived as interesting by human evaluators.
