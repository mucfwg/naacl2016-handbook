Abstract#==#Zara the Supergirl is an interactive system that, while having a conversation
with a user, uses its built in sentiment analysis, emotion recognition, facial
and speech recognition modules, to exhibit the human-like response of sharing
emotions. In addition, at the end of a 5-10 minute conversation with the user,
it can give a comprehensive personality analysis based on the userâ€™s
interaction with Zara. This is a first prototype that has incorporated a full
empathy module, the recognition and response of human emotions, into a spoken
language interactive system that enhances human-robot understanding. Zara was
shown at the World Economic Forum in Dalian in September 2015.
