Abstract#==#Word clusters improve performance in many NLP tasks including training neural
network language models, but current increases in datasets are outpacing the
ability of word clusterers to handle them. In this paper we present a novel
bidirectional, interpolated, refining, and alternating (BIRA) predictive
exchange algorithm and introduce ClusterCat, a clusterer based on this
algorithm. We show that ClusterCat is 3-85 times faster than four other
well-known clusterers, while also improving upon the predictive exchange
algorithm's perplexity by up to 18%. Notably, ClusterCat clusters a 2.5 billion
token English News Crawl corpus in 3 hours. We also evaluate in a machine
translation setting, resulting in shorter training times achieving the same
translation quality measured in BLEU scores. ClusterCat is portable and freely
available.
