Abstract#==#We present a simple, prepackaged solution to generating paraphrases of English
sentences. We use the Paraphrase Database (PPDB) for monolingual sentence
rewriting and provide machine translation language packs: prepackaged, tuned
models that can be downloaded and used to generate paraphrases on a standard
Unix environment. The language packs can be treated as a black box or
customized to specific tasks. In this demonstration, we will explain how to use
the included interactive web-based tool to generate sentential paraphrases.
