Abstract#==#New Dimensions in Testimony is a prototype dialogue system that allows users to
conduct a conversation with a real person who is not available for conversation
in real time. Users talk to a persistent representation of Holocaust survivor
Pinchas Gutter on a screen, while a dialogue agent selects appropriate
responses to user utterances from a set of pre-recorded video statements,
simulating a live conversation. The technology is similar to existing
conversational agents, but to our knowledge this is the first system to portray
a real person. The demonstration will show the system on a range of screens
(from mobile phones to large TVs), and allow users to have individual
conversations with Mr. Gutter.
