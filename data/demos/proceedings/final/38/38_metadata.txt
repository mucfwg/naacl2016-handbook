Abstract#==#In this paper, we present Kathaa, an open source web based Visual
Programming Framework for NLP applications. It supports design, execution and
analysis of complex NLP systems by choosing and visually connecting NLP modules
from an already available and easily extensible Module library. It models NLP
systems as a Directed Acyclic Graph of optionally parallalized information
flow, and lets the user choose and use available modules in their NLP
applications irrespective of their technical proficiency. Kathaa exposes a
precise Module definition API to allow easy integration of external NLP
components (along with their associated services as docker containers), it
allows everyone to publish their services in a standardized format for everyone
else to use it out of the box.
