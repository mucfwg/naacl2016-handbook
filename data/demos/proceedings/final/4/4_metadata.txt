Abstract#==#This paper presents rstWeb, a new browser-based interface for Rhetorical
Structure Theory and other discourse relation annotations. Expanding on
previous tools for RST, rstWeb allows annotators to work online using only a
browser. Project administrators can easily collect multiple annotations of the
same documents on a central server, keep track of annotation processes and
assign tasks and annotation schemes to users. A local version using an embedded
web framework is also available, running offline on a desktop browser under the
localhost.
