Abstract#==#This paper presents a tag-based statistical math word problem solver with
understanding, reasoning, and explanation. It analyzes the text and transforms
both body and question parts into their tag-based logic forms, and then
performs inference on them. The proposed tag-based approach provides the
flexibility for annotating an extracted math quantity with its associated
syntactic and semantic information, which can be used to identify the desired
operand and filter out irrelevant quantities. The proposed approach is thus
less sensitive to the irrelevant information and could provide the answer more
precisely. Also, it can handle much more problem types other than addition and
subtraction.
