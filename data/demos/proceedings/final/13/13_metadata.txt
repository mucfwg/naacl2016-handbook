Abstract#==#We present an extension to Appraise, an open source toolkit for human
evaluation, to integrate eye-tracking functionality. Our goal is to analyze the
human evaluation process based on the information collected from the gaze data.
We modified the user interface (UI) for Appraise to communicate with an
eye-tracking device, and collect the gaze data. Gaze signals captured by the
eyetracker during the evaluation process, augmented with the word coordinates
in the UI, results in gaze data. Such data i) invites researchers to propose
models to predict human scores, ii) can serve to analyze evaluation process. To
this end, we provide an analysis module, based on data collected during the
evaluation session and the additional eye-tracking features.
