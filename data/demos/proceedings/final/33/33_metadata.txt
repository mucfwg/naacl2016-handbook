Abstract#==#We demonstrate SODA (Service Oriented Domain Adaptation) for efficient and
scalable cross-domain microblog categorization which works on the principle of
transfer learning. It is developed on a novel similarity-based iterative domain
adaptation algorithm while extended with features such as active learning and
interactive GUI to be used by business professionals. SODA demonstrates
efficient classification accuracy on new collections while minimizing and
sometimes eliminating the need for expensive data labeling efforts. SODA also
implements an active learning (AL) technique to select informative instances
from the new collection to seek annotations, if a small amount of labeled data
is required by the adaptation algorithm.
