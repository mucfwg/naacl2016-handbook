Abstract#==#LingoTurk is an open-source, freely available crowdsourcing client/server
system aimed primarily at psycholinguistic experimentation where custom and
specialized user interfaces are required but not supported by popular
crowdsourcing task management platforms. LingoTurk enables user-friendly local
hosting of experiments as well as condition management and participant
exclusion. It is compatible with Amazon Mechanical Turk and Prolific Academic.
New experiments can easily be set up via the Play Framework and the LingoTurk
API, while multiple experiments can be managed from a single system.
