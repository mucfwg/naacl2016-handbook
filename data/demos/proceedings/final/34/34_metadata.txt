Abstract#==#Foreign students at German universities often have difficulties following
lectures as they are often held in German.
Since human interpreters are too expensive for universities we are addressing
this problem via speech translation technology deployed in KIT's lecture halls.
Our simultaneous lecture translation system automatically translates lectures
from German to English in real-time. Other supported language directions are
English to Spanish, English to French, English to German and German to French.
Automatic simultaneous translation is more than just the concatenation of
automatic speech recognition and machine translation technology, as the input
is an unsegmented, practically infinite stream of spontaneous speech. The lack
of segmentation and the spontaneous nature of the speech makes it especially
difficult to recognize and translate it with sufficient quality. In addition to
quality, speed and latency are of the utmost importance in order for the system
to enable students to follow lectures. In this paper we present our system that
performs the task of simultaneous speech translation of university lectures by
performing speech translation on a stream of audio in real-time and with low
latency. The system features several techniques beyond the basic speech
translation task, that make it fit for real-world use. Examples of these
features are a continuous stream speech recognition without any prior
segmentation of the input audio, punctuation prediction, run-on decoding and
run-on translation with continuously updating displays in order to keep the
latency as low as possible.
