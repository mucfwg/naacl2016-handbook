Abstract#==#While intelligent writing assistants have become more common, they typically
have little support for revision behavior. We present ArgRewrite, a novel
web-based revision assistant that focus on rewriting analysis. The system
supports two major functionalities: 1) to assist students as they revise, the
system automatically extracts and analyzes revisions; 2) to assist teachers,
the system provides an overview of studentsâ€™ revisions and allow teachers to
correct the automatically analyzed results, ensuring that students get the
correct feedback.
