Abstract#==#This paper introduces Linguistica 5, a software for unsupervised learning of
linguistic structure. It is a descendant of Goldsmith's (2001, 2006)
Linguistica. Open-source and written in Python, the new Linguistica 5 is both a
graphical user interface software and a Python library. While Linguistica 5
inherits its predecessors' strength in unsupervised learning of natural
language morphology, it incorporates significant improvements in multiple ways.
Notable new features include tools for data visualization as well as
straightforward extensions for both its components and embedding in other
programs.
