Abstract#==#There has been a recent interest in understanding text to perform
  mathematical reasoning. In particular, most of these efforts have
  focussed on automatically solving school level math word problems.
  In order to make advancements in this area accessible to people, as
  well as to facilitate this line of research, we release the
  Illinois Math Solver, a web based tool that supports
  performing mathematical reasoning. Illinois Math Solver can
  answer a wide range of mathematics questions, ranging from
  compositional operation questions like ``What is the result when               
 

  6 is divided by the sum of 7 and 5 ?''  to elementary school
  level math word problems, like ``I bought 6 apples. I ate 3 of  
  them. How many do I have left ?". The web based demo can be used
  as a tutoring tool for elementary school students, since it not only
  outputs the final result, but also the mathematical expression to
  compute it. The tool will allow researchers to understand the
  capabilities and limitations of a state of the art arithmetic
  problem solver, and also enable crowd based data acquisition for
  mathematical reasoning.  The system is currently online at
