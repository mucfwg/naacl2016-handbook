Abstract#==#We present the design and evaluation of a web-based peer review system that
uses natural language processing to automatically evaluate and provide instant
feedback regarding the presence of solutions in peer reviews. Student reviewers
can then choose to either revise their reviews to address the system's
feedback, or ignore the feedback and submit their original reviews. A system
deployment in multiple high school classrooms shows that our solution
prediction model triggers instant feedback with high precision, and that the
feedback is successful in increasing the number of peer reviews with solutions.
