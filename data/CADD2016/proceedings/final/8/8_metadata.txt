Abstract#==#In this paper we present an initial experiment in the estimation of the
amenability of new domains to true/false classification. We choose four
domains, two of which have been classified for deception, and use the
out-of-rank distance measure on n-grams to aid in deciding whether the third
and fourth domains are amenable to T/F classification. We then use a classifier
covered in the literature to train and test on the verified domains to
de-termine whether the relative similarity among the domains can be a predictor
of classifica-tion accuracy.
