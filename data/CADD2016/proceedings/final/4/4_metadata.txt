Abstract#==#Satire is an attractive subject in deception detection research: it is a type
of deception that intentionally incorporates cues revealing its own
deceptiveness. Whereas other types of fabrications aim to instill a false sense
of truth in the reader, a successful satirical hoax must eventually be exposed
as a jest. This paper provides a conceptual overview of satire and humor,
elaborating and illustrating the unique features of satirical news, which
mimics the format and style of journalistic reporting. Satirical news stories
were carefully matched and examined in contrast with their legitimate news
counterparts in 12 contemporary news topics in 4 domains (civics, science,
business, and “soft” news). Building on previous work in satire detection,
we proposed an SVM-based algorithm, enriched with 5 predictive features
(Absurdity, Humor, Grammar, Negative Affect, and Punctuation) and tested their
combinations on 360 news articles. Our best predicting feature combination
(Absurdity, Grammar and Punctuation) detects satirical news with a 90%
precision and 84% recall (F-score=87%). Our work in algorithmically identifying
satirical news pieces can aid in minimizing the potential deceptive impact of
satire.
