Abstract#==#While text-based deception in computer mediated communication has been studied,
e.g., Zhou (2005) and Duran et al. (2010), there has been less focus on the
differentiation of strategies for deception, especially those which may
manifest in  modern communication, such as found in social media. In this
paper, we extend our previous work on the evaluation of linguistic indicators
to strategic deception (Appling et al., 2015), by evaluating the relationship
between personality and deceptive strategy use and the utilization of
linguistic features for inferring both (personality and deception). We find
that even with a relatively small corpus, there is evidence that personality is
related to particular deception strategies, though in short social media
communications, these personality traits are difficult to infer using standard
linguistic measures (e.g., LIWC). We also describe the corpus we collected from
an experiment in which subjects engaged in deception through a social media
platform.
