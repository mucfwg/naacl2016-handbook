Abstract#==#The Verifiability Approach (VA) is a promising new approach for deception
detection. It extends existing verbal credibility assessment tools by asking
interviewees to provide statements rich in verifiable detail. Details that i)
have been experienced with an identifiable person, ii) have been witnessed by
an identifiable person, or iii) have been recorded through technology, are
labelled as verifiable. With only minimal modifications of
information-gathering interviews this approach has yielded remarkable
classification accuracies. Currently, the VA relies on extensive manual
annotation by human coders. Aiming to extend the VAâ€™s applicability, we
present a work in progress on automated VA scoring. We provide a conceptual
outline of two automation approaches: one being based on the Linguistic Inquiry
and Word Count software and the other on rule-based shallow parsing and named
entity recognition. Differences between both approaches and possible future
steps for an automated VA are discussed.
