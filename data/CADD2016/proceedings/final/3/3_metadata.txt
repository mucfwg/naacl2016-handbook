Abstract#==#Social networks are dynamically changing over time e.g., some accounts are
being created and some are being deleted or become private.  This ephemerality
at both an account level and content level results from a combination of
privacy concerns, spam, and deceptive behaviors. In this study we analyze a
large dataset of 180,340 accounts active during the Russian-Ukrainian crisis to
discover a series of predictive features for the removal or shutdown of a
suspicious account.  We find that unlike previously reported profile and
network features, lexical features form the basis for highly accurate
prediction of the deletion of an account.
