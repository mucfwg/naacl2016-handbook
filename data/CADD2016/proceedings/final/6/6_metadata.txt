Abstract#==#Detecting deception in natural language is a problem amenable to economic
analysis.
Economics typically assumes that individuals are self-interested, which leads
them to perform actions in accord with their own goals.
The field of experimental economics emerged to construct environments wherein
human subjects make decisions so as to test economic hypotheses.
Experimental economists recently have developed virtual worlds to better
situate experiment subjects in more realistic environments.
Virtual word experiments represent an exciting new area for deception research
as they offer insight into individuals both acting out and communicating in
accord with their intentions.
This paper describes the use of virtual world experiments for economic research
incorporating the detection of deceptive individuals.
