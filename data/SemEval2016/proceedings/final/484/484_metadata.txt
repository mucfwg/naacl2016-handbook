Abstract#==#We participated in the shared task on meaning representation parsing (Task 8 at
SemEval-2016) with the aim of investigating whether we could use Boxer, an
existing open-domain semantic parser, for this task.
However, the meaning representations produced by Boxer, Discourse
Representation Structures, are considerably different from Abstract Meaning
Representations, AMRs, the target meaning representations of the shared task. 
Our hybrid conversion method (involving lexical adaptation as well as
post-processing of the output) failed to produce state-of-the-art results.
Nonetheless, F-scores of 53% on development and 47% on test data (50%
unofficially) were obtained.
