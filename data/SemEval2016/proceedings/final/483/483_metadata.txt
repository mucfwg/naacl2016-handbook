Abstract#==#This paper describes our systems submitted to the Sentence-level and Text-level
Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) task (i.e., Task 5) in SemEval-2016.
The task involves two phases, namely, Aspect Detection phase and Sentiment
Polarity Classification phase. We participated in the second phase of both
subtasks in laptop and restaurant domains, which focuses on the sentiment
analysis based on the given aspect. In this task, we extracted four types of
features (i.e., Sentiment Lexicon Features, Linguistic Features, Topic Model
Features and Word2vec Feature) from certain fragments related to  aspect rather
than the whole sentence. Then the proposed features are fed into supervised
classifiers for sentiment analysis. Our submissions rank above average.
