Abstract#==#This paper describes our system submitted for the Sentiment Analysis in Twitter
task of SemEval-2016, and specifically for the Message Polarity Classification

Logistic Regression for sentiment prediction, where the former makes use of
embedding features while the later utilizes various features like lexicons and
