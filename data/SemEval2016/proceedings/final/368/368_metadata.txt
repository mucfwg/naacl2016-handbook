Abstract#==#This paper describes our submission to the SemEval-2016 Taxonomy Extraction
Evaluation (TExEval-2) Task. We examine the endocentric nature of hyponyms and
propose a simple rule-based method to identify hypernyms at high precision. For
the food domain, we extract lists of terms from the Wikiepedia lists of lists
by using the name of each list as the endocentric head and treating all terms
in the extracted tables as the hyponym of the endocentric head. 

Our submission achieved competitive results in taxonomy construction and ranked
top in hypernym identification when evaluated against gold standard taxonomies
and also in manual evaluation of novel relations not covered by the gold
standard taxonomies.
