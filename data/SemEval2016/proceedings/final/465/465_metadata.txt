Abstract#==#We introduce a system focused on solving SemEval 2016 Task 2 - Interpretable
Semantic Textual Similarity. The system explores machine learning and
rule-based approaches to the task. We focus on machine learning and experiment
with a wide variety of machine learning algorithms as well as with several
types of features. The core of our system consists in exploiting distributional
semantics to compare similarity of sentence chunks. The system won the
competition in 2016 in the ''Gold standard chunk scenario''. We have not
participated in the ''System chunk scenario''.
