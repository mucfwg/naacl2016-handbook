Abstract#==#Given two sentences, participating systems assign a semantic similarity score
in the range of 0-5. We applied two different techniques for the task: one is
based on lexical semantic net (corresponding to run 1) and the other is based
on deep learning semantic model (corresponding to run 2). We also combined
these two runs linearly (corresponding to run 3). Our results indicate that the
two techniques perform comparably while the combination outperforms the
individual ones on four out of five datasets, namely answer-answer, headlines,
plagiarism, and question-question, and on the overall weighted mean of STS 2016
and 2015 datasets.
