Abstract#==#This paper describes our sentiment analysis system which has been built for
Sentiment Analysis in Twitter Task of SemEval-2016. We have used a Logistic
Regression classifier with different groups of features. This system is an
improvement to our previous system Lsislif  in Semeval-2015 after removing some
features and adding  new features extracted from a new automatic constructed
sentiment lexicon.
