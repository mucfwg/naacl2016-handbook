Abstract#==#In this paper we describe a deep learning system that has been built for
SemEval 2016 Task4 (Subtask A and B). In this work we trained a Gated Recurrent
Unit (GRU) neural network model on top of two sets of word embeddings: (a)
general word embeddings generated from unsupervised neural language model; and
(b) task specific word embeddings generated from supervised neural language
model that was trained to classify tweets into positive and negative
categories. We also added a method for analyzing and splitting multi-words
hashtags and appending them to the tweet body before feeding it to our model.
Our models achieved 0.58 F1-measure for Subtask A (ranked 12/35) and 0.679
Recall for Subtask B (ranked 12/19).
