Abstract#==#We present a shared task on automatically determining sentiment intensity of a
word or a phrase. The words and phrases are taken from three domains: general
English, English Twitter, and Arabic Twitter. The phrases include those
composed of negators, modals, and degree adverbs as well as phrases formed by
words with opposing polarities. For each of the three domains, we assembled the
datasets that include multi-word phrases and their constituent words, both
manually annotated for real-valued sentiment intensity scores. The three
datasets were presented as the test sets for three separate tasks (each
focusing on a specific domain). Five teams submitted nine system outputs for
the three tasks. All datasets created for this shared task are freely available
to the research community.
