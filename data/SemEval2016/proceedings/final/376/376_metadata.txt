Abstract#==#This paper describes VUACLTL, the system the CLTL Lab submitted to the SemEval
2016 Task Clinical TempEval. The system is based on a purely data-driven
approach based
on a cascade of seven CRF classifiers which use generic features and little
domain knowledge. The challenge consisted in six subtasks related to temporal
processing clinical notes from raw text (event and temporal expression
detection and attribute classification, temporal relation classification
between events and the Document Creation Time, and narrative container
detection). The system was initially developed to process newswire texts and
then
re-trained to process clinical notes. This had an impact on the results, which
are not equally competitive for all the subtasks.
