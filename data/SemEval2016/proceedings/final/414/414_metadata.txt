Abstract#==#This paper introduces aicyber's systems for SemEval 2016 , Task 4A. The first
system is build on vector space model, the second system is build on a new
framework to estimate sentence vector, it is inspired by the i-vector in
speaker verification domain. Both systems are evaluated on SemEval 2016
(Task4A) as well as IMDB dataset. Evaluation results show that the i-vector
based sentence vector is an alternative approach to present sentence.
