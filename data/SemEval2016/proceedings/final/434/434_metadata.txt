Abstract#==#We describe the system submitted to the SemEval-2016 for detecting stance in
tweets (Task 6, Subtask A). One of the main goals of stance detection is to
automatically determine the stance of a tweet towards a specific target as
‘FAVOR’, ‘AGAINST’, or ‘NONE’. We developed a supervised system
using Support Vector Machines to identify the stance by analyzing various
lexical and semantic features. The average F1 score achieved by our system is
60.60.
