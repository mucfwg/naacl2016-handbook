Abstract#==#In this paper, we present a novel deep learning architecture for sentiment
analysis in Twitter messages. Our system finki, employs both convolutional and
gated recurrent neural networks to obtain a more diverse tweet representation.
The network is trained on top of GloVe word embeddings pre-trained on the
Common Crawl dataset. Both neural networks are used to obtain a fixed length
representation of variable sized tweets, and the concatenation of these vectors
is supplied to a fully connected softmax layer with dropout regularization. The
system is evaluated on benchmark datasets from the Sentiment Analysis in
Twitter task of the SemEval 2016 challenge where our model achieves best and
second highest results on the 2-point and 5-point quantification subtasks
respectively. Despite not relying on any hand-crafted features, our system
manages the second highest average rank on the considered subtasks.
