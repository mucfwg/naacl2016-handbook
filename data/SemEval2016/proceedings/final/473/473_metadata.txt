Abstract#==#This paper presents our system description submitted to the Aspect Based
Sentiment Analysis Task of SemEval-2016 (Task 5). Our system is built on linear
binary classifiers for aspect category classification (Slot 1), lexicon-based
detection of opinion target expres-sions (Slot 2), and linear multi-class
classifi-ers for sentiment polarity detection (Slot 3). We conducted several
different approaches for feature selection to improve classification
performance on both Slot 1 and Slot 3. Our proposed methods are easily
adaptable to all languages and domains since they are built as constrained
systems which do not use any additional resources other than the provided
datasets and which uses standard prepro-cessing methods.
