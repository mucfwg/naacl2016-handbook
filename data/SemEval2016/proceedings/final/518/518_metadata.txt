Abstract#==#In this paper we describe our approach to the Abstract Meaning Representation
(AMR) parsing shared task as part of SemEval 2016. We develop a novel technique
to parse English sentences into AMR using Learning to Search. We decompose the
AMR parsing task into three subtasks - that of predicting the concepts, the
relations, and the root. Each of these subtasks are treated as a sequence of
predictions. Using Learning to Search, we add past predictions as features for
future predictions, and define a combined loss over the entire AMR structure.
