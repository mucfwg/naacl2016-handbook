Abstract#==#This paper presents the MacSaar system developed to identify complex words in
English texts. MacSaar participated in the SemEval 2016 task 11: Complex Word
Identification submitting two runs. The system is based on the assumption that
complex words are likely to be less frequent and on average longer than words
considered to be simple. We report results of 82.5% accuracy and 27% F-Score
using a Random Forest Classifier. The best MacSaar submission was ranked 8th in
terms of F-Measure among 45 entries.
