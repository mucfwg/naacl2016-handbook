Abstract#==#Our experiments rely on a combination of machine-learning (CRF) and rule-based
(HeidelTime) systems. First, a CRF system identifies both EVENTS and TIMEX3,
along with polarity values for EVENT and types of TIMEX. Second, the HeidelTime
tool  identifies DOCTIME and TIMEX3 elements, and computes DocTimeRel for each
EVENT identified by the CRF. Third, another CRF system computes DocTimeRel for
each previously identified EVENT, based on DocTimeRel computed by HeidelTime.
In the first submission, all EVENTS and TIMEX3 are identified through one
general CRF model while in the second submission, we combined two CRF models
(one for both EVENT and TIMEX3, and one only for TIMEX3) and we applied
post-processing rules on the outputs.
