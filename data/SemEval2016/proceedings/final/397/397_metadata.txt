Abstract#==#We present an approach for tackling the tweet quantification problem in SemEval
2016. The approach is based on the creation of a cooccurrence graph per
sentiment from the training dataset and a graph per topic from the test dataset
with the aim of comparing each topic graph against the sentiment graphs and
evaluate the similarity between them. A heuristic is applied on those
similarities to calculate the percentage of positive and negative texts. The
overall result obtained for the test dataset according to the proposed task
score (KL divergence) is 0.261, showing that the graph based representation and
heuristic could be a way of quantifying the percentage of tweets that are
positive and negative in a given set of texts about a topic.
