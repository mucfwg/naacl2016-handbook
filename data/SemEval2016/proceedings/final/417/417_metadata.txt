Abstract#==#The 2016 Clinical TempEval continued 
the 2015 shared task
on temporal information extraction with a new evaluation  test set. 
Our team, UtahBMI,  participated in all subtasks using machine learning
approaches with ClearTK (LIBLINEAR), CRF++ and CRFsuite packages. 
Our experiments show that 
CRF-based classifiers yield, in general, higher recall for multi-word spans,
while SVM-based classifiers are better at predicting correct attributes of
TIMEX3. In addition, we show that an ensemble-based approach for TIMEX3 could
yield improved results. Our team achieved competitive results in each subtask
with an  F1 75.4\% for TIMEX3, F1 89.2\% for EVENT, F1 84.4\% for event
relations with document time (DocTimeRel), and F1 51.1\% for narrative
container (CONTAINS) relations.
