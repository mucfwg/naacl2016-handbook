Abstract#==#This paper presents our participation to the
SemEval ``Task 13: Taxonomy Extraction Evaluation (TExEval-2)''.
This year, we propose the combination of recent semantic vectors representation
into a methodology for semisupervised
and auto-supervised acquisition of
lexical taxonomies from raw texts. In our proposal, first similarities between
concepts are calculated using semantic vectors, then a pretopological space is
defined from which a preliminary structure is constructed. Finally, a genetic
algorithm is used to optimize two different functions, the quality of the added
relationships in the taxonomy and the quality of the structure. Experiments
show that our proposal has a competitive performance when compared with the
other participants achieving the second position in the general rank.
