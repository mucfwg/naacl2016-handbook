Abstract#==#We present a system for answer ranking (SemEval-2016 Task 3, Subtask A) that is
a direct adaptation of a pairwise neural network model for machine translation
evaluation (MTE). In particular, the network incorporates MTE features, as well
as rich syntactic and semantic embeddings, and it efficiently models complex
non-linear interactions between them. With the addition of lightweight
task-specific features, we obtained very encouraging experimental results, with
sizeable contributions from both the MTE features and from the pairwise network
architecture. We also achieved good results on subtask C.
