Abstract#==#We present a multi-feature system for computing the semantic similarity between
two sentences. We introduce the use of soft alignment for computing text
similarity, and evaluate also different methods to produce it. The main
features used by our system are based on soft and hard alignment between the
sentences, and Explicit Semantic Analysis. Our system stood above the median
scores for 4 out of the 5 datasets at SemEval 2016 STS Task 1.
