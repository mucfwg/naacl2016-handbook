Abstract#==#We describe our entry to  SemEval 2016 Task 10: Detecting Minimal Semantic
Units and their Meanings.  Our approach uses a discriminative first-order
sequence model similar to \newcite{schneider2015corpus}.  The chief novelty in
our approach is a factorization of the labels into multiword expression and
supersense labels, and restricting first-order dependencies within these two
parts.                          Our submitted models achieved first place in the
closed
competition
(CRF) and second place in the open competition (2-CRF).
