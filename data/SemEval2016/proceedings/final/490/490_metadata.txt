Abstract#==#The 2016 Clinical TempEval challenge addresses temporal information extraction
from clinical notes. The challenge is composed of six sub-tasks, each of which
is to identify: (1) event mention spans, (2) time expression spans, (3) event
attributes, (4) time attributes, (5) eventsâ€™ temporal relations to the
document
creation times (DocTimeRel), and (6) narrative container relations among events
and times. In this article, we present an end-to-end system that addresses all
six sub-tasks. Our system achieved the best performance for all six sub-tasks
when plain texts were given as input. It also performed best for narrative
container relation identification when gold standard event/time annotations
were given.
