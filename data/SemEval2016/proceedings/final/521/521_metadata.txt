Abstract#==#This paper describes our system developed for English Monolingual subtask (STS
Core) of SemEval-2016 Task 1: “Semantic Textual Similarity: A Unified
Framework for Semantic Processing and Evaluation”. We measure the similarity
between two sentences using three different types of features, including word
alignment-based similarity, sentence vector-based similarity and sentence
constituent similarity. The best performance of our submitted runs is a mean
0.69996 Pearson correlation which outperforms the median score from all
participating systems.
