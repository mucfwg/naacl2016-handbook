Abstract#==#We experiment with learning word representations designed to be combined into
sentence-level semantic representations, using an objective function which does
not directly make use of the supervised scores provided with the training data,
instead opting for a simpler objective which encourages similar phrases to be
close together in the embedding space. This simple objective lets us start with
high-quality embeddings trained using PPDB~\cite{Wieting16paragram,ppdb:2013},
and then tune these embeddings using the official STS task training data, as
well as synthetic paraphrases for each test dataset, obtained by pivoting
through machine translation. 

Our submissions include runs which only compare the similarity of phrases in
the embedding space, directly using the similarity score to produce
predictions, as well as a run which uses vector similarity in addition to a
suite of features we investigated for our 2015 Semeval submission.

For the crosslingual task, we simply translate the Spanish sentences to
English, and use the same system we designed for the monolingual task.
