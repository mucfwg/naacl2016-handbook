Abstract#==#We present a matrix factorization model for learning cross-lingual
representations for sentences. Using sentence-aligned corpora, the proposed
model learns distributed representations by factoring the given data into
language-dependent factors and one shared factor. As a result, input sentences
from both languages can be mapped into fixed-length vectors and then compared
directly using the cosine similarity measure, which achieves 0.8 Pearson
correlation on Spanish-English semantic textual similarity.
