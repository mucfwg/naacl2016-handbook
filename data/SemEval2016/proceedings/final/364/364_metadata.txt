Abstract#==#This paper describes the system with which we participated in SemEval-2016 Task
4 (Sentiment Analysis in Twitter) and specifically the Message Polarity
Classification subtask. Our system is a weighted ensemble of two systems. The
first one is based on a previous sentiment analysis system and uses manually
crafted features. The second system of our ensemble uses features based on word
embeddings. Our ensemble was ranked 5th among 34 teams. The source code of our
system is publicly available.
