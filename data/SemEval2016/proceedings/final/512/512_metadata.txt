Abstract#==#We describe MITREâ€™s submission to the SemEval-2016 Task 6, Detecting Stance
in Tweets. This effort achieved the top score in Task A on supervised stance
detection, producing an average F1 score of 67.8 when assessing whether a tweet
author was in favor or against a topic. We employed a recurrent neural network
initialized with features learned via distant supervision on two large
unlabeled datasets. We trained embeddings of words and phrases with the
word2vec skip-gram method, then used those features to learn sentence
representations via a hashtag prediction auxiliary task. These sentence vectors
were then fine- tuned for stance detection on several hundred labeled examples.
The result was a high performing system that used transfer learning to maximize
the value of the available training data.
