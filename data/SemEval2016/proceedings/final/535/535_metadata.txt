Abstract#==#We present improvements to the JAMR parser as part of the SemEval 2016 Shared
Task 8 on AMR parsing. The major contributions are: improved concept coverage
using external resources and features, an improved aligner, and a novel loss
function for structured prediction called infinite ramp, which is a
generalization of the structured SVM to problems with unreachable training
instances.
