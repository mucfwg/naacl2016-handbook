Abstract#==#In this paper, we develop a convolutional neural network for stance detection
in tweets. According to the official results, our system ranks
$\mathrm{1^{st}}$ on subtask B (among 9 teams) and ranks $\mathrm{2^{nd}}$ on
subtask A (among 19 teams) on the twitter test set of SemEval2016 Task 6. The
main contribution of our work is as follows. We design a "vote scheme" for
prediction instead of predicting when the accuracy of validation set reaches
its maximum. Besides, we make some improvement on the specific subtasks. For
subtask A, we separate datasets into five sub-datasets according to their
targets, and train and test five separate models.  For subtask B, we establish
a two-class training dataset from the official domain corpus, and then modify
the softmax layer to perform three-class classification. Our system can be
easily re-implemented and optimized for other related tasks.
