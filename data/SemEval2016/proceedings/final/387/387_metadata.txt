Abstract#==#We present the system developed at FBK for the SemEval 2016 Shared Task 2
"Interpretable Semantic Textual Similarity" as well as the results of the
submitted runs. We use a single  neural network classification model for
predicting the alignment at chunk level,  the relation type of the alignment 
and  the similarity scores. Our best run was ranked as first in one the
subtracks (i.e. raw input data, Student Answers), among 12 runs submitted.
