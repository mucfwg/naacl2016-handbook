Abstract#==#We describe the systems entered by the National Research Council Canada in the
SemEval-2016 Task1: Crosslingual Semantic Textual Similarity. We tried two
approaches: One computes a true crosslingual similarity based on features
extracted from lexical semantics and shallow semantic structures of the source
and target fragments, combined using a linear model.  The other approach relies
on Statistical Machine Translation, followed by a monolingual semantic
similarity, relying again on syntactic and semantic features. We report our
experiments using trial data, as well as official final results on the
evaluation data.
