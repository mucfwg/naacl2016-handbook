Abstract#==#This paper presents the participation of the TALN team in the Complex Word
Identification Task of SemEval-2016 (Task 11). The purpose of the task was to
determine if a word in a given sentence can be judged as complex or not by a
certain target audience. To experiment with word complexity identification
approaches, Task organizers provided a training set of 2,237 words judged as
complex or not by 20 human evaluators, together with the sentence in which each
word occurs. In our contribution we modelled each word to evaluate as a numeric
vector populated with a set of lexical, semantic and contextual features that
may help assess the complexity of a word. We trained a Random Forest classifier
to automatically decide if each word is complex or not. We submitted two runs
in which we respectively considered unweighted and weighted instances of
complex words to train our classifier, where the weight of each instance is
proportional to the number of evaluators that judged the word as complex. Our
system scored as the third best performing one.
