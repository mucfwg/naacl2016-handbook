Abstract#==#In this paper we describe the participation of the Joint Research Centre, EC,
in task 14 - Semantic Taxonomy Enrichment at SemEval 2016.
The algorithm which we propose transforms each candidate definition into a term
vector, where each dimension represents a term and its value 
is calculated by TF.IDF. We attach the candidate term as a hyponym to the
WordNet synset with the most similar definition. The results we obtained 
are encouraging, considering the simplicity of our approach. The obtained F
measure is  below the average, but above one of the baselines.
