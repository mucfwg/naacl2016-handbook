Abstract#==#Extraction and interpretation of temporal information from clinical text is
essential for clinical practitioners and researchers. SemEval 2016 Task 12
(Clinical TempEval) addressed this challenge using the THYME 1 corpus, a corpus
of clinical narratives annotated with temporal information with TimeML 2
guidelines. We developed and evaluated approaches for: extraction of temporal
expressions (TIMEX3) and EVENTs; TIMEX3 and EVENT attributes; document-time
relations; and narrative container relations. Our approach is based on
supervised learning (CRF and logistic regression), utilizing various sets of
syntactic, lexical and semantic features with addition of manually crafted
rules. Our system demonstrated substantial improvements over the baselines in
all the tasks.
