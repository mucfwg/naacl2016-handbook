Abstract#==#In this paper we describe our system (DTSim) submitted at SemEval-2016 Shared
Task 2: Interpretable Semantic Textual Similarity (iSTS). We participated in
both gold chunks category (texts chunked by human experts and provided by the
task organizers) and system chunks category (participants had to automatically
chunk the input texts). We developed a Conditional Random Fields based chunker
and applied rules blended with semantic similarity methods in order to predict
chunk alignments, alignment types and similarity scores. Our system obtained F1
score up to 0.648 in predicting the chunk alignment types and scores together
and was one of the top performing systems overall.
