Abstract#==#This paper describes a classification system that participated in SemEval-2016
Task 4: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter. The proposed approach competed in
subtasks A, B, and C, which involved tweet polarity classification, tweet
classification according to a two-point scale, and tweet classification
according to a five-point scale. Our system is based on an ensemble consisting
of Random Forests, SVMs, and Gradient Boosting Trees, and involves the use of a
wide range of features including: n-grams, Brown clustering, sentiment
lexicons, Wordnet, and part-of-speech tagging. The proposed system achieved
14th, 6th, and 3rd place in subtasks A, B, and C, respectively.
