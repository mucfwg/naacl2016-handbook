Abstract#==#This paper presents our approach towards the SemEval-2016 Task 10 -- Detecting
Minimal Semantic Units and their Meanings. Systems are expected to provide a
representation of lexical semantics by (1) segmenting tokens into words and
multiword units and (2) providing a supersense tag for segments that function
as nouns or verbs.
Our pipeline rule-based system uses no external resources and was implemented
using the mwetoolkit. First, we extract and filter known MWEs from the training
corpus. Second, we group input tokens of the test corpus based on this lexicon,
with special treatment for non-contiguous expressions. Third, we use an
MWE-aware predominant-sense heuristic for supersense tagging.
We obtain an F-score of 51.48% for MWE identification and 49.98% for supersense
tagging.
