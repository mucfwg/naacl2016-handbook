Abstract#==#This paper describes the VCU systems that participated in the Semantic 
Taxonomy Enrichment task of SemEval 2016. The three systems are unsupervised 
and relied on dictionary-based similarity measures. The first two 
runs used first-order measures (lesk and first-order vector), and the third 
run used a second-order measure (second-order vector). The first-order 
measures obtained a higher Wu & Palmer score than the second-order measure 
in the test data. All three runs obtained a higher Wu \& Palmer and F1 
score than the random baseline but not the first-word first-sense baseline.
