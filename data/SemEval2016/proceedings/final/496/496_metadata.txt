Abstract#==#This paper presents the submission of our
team (NORMAS) to the SemEval 2016 semantic
textual similarity (STS) shared task.
We submitted three system runs, each using
a set of 36 features extracted from the training
set. The runs explore the use of the following
three machine learning algorithms: Support
Vector Regression, Elastic Net and Random
Forest. Each run was trained using sentence
pairs from the STS 2012 training data. Features
extracted include lexical, syntactic and
semantic features. This paper describes the
features we designed for assessing the semantic
similarity between sentence pairs, the models
we build using these features and the performance
obtained by the resulting systems on
the 2016 evaluation data.
