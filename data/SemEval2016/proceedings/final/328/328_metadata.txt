Abstract#==#This is a system description paper for a submission to Task 8 of SemEval-2016:
Meaning Representation Parsing.  No use was made of the training data provided
by the task.  Instead existing components were combined to form a pipeline able
to take raw sentences as input and output meaning representations.  Components
are a part-of-speech tagger and parser trained on the Penn Parsed Corpus of
Modern British English to produce syntactic parse trees, a semantic role
labeller and a named entity recogniser to supplement obtained parse trees with
word sense, functional and named entity information, followed by an adapted
Tarskian satisfaction relation for a Dynamic Semantics that is used to
transform a syntactic parse into a predicate logic based meaning
representation, followed by conversion to penman notation required for the task
appraisal.
