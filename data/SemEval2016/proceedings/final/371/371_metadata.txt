Abstract#==#This paper describes the system deployed by the CLaC-EDLK team to the SemEval
2016, Complex Word Identification task. The goal is to identify if a given word
in a given context is simple or complex. Our system relies on linguistic
features and cognitive complexity. We used several supervised models; however
the Random Forest model outperformed the others. Overall we achieved a
performance of 68.8% in the task, ranking us 21 out of 45 systems.
