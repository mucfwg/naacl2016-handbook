Abstract#==#In many areas, such as social science, politics or market research, people need
to track sentiment and their changes over time. For sentiment analysis in this
field it is more important to correctly estimate proportions of each sentiment
expressed in the set of documents (quantification task) than to accurately
estimate sentiment of a particular document (classification). Basically, our
study was aimed to analyze the effectiveness of two iterative quantification
techniques and to compare their effectiveness with baseline methods. All the
techniques are evaluated using a set of synthesized data and the SemEval-2016
Task4 dataset. We made the quantification methods from this paper available as
a Python open source library. The results of comparison and possible
limitations of the quantification techniques are discussed.
