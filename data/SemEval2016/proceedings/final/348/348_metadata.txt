Abstract#==#This paper describes the NUIG-UNLP system submitted to SemEval-2016, Task 13.
We implement a semi-supervised method that extracts hypernym candidates for the
terms provided in the test list. The main assumption of our system is that
hypernyms may be induced by adding a vector offset to the corresponding hyponym
word embedding. The vector offset is obtained as the average offset between 200
pairs of hyponym-hypernym in the same vector space. Our approach ranked second
on
connectivity (c.c.) and categorisation (i.i.) for the English taxonomy
construction, and fifth on the overall ranking. Despite of these modest
results, our system achieved comparable evaluations scores with the other
participants.
