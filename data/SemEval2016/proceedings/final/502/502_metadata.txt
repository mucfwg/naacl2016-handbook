Abstract#==#The aim of this paper is to produce a methodology for analyzing sentiments of
selected Twitter messages, better known as Tweets. This project elaborates on
two experiments carried out to analyze the sentiment of Tweets from 
SemEval-2016 Task 4 Subtask A and Subtask B. Our
method is built from a simple unigram model baseline with three main feature
enhancements incorporated into the model: 1) emoticon retention, 2) word
stemming, and 3) token saliency calculation. Our results indicate an increase
in classification accuracy with the addition of emoticon retention and word
stemming, while token saliency shows mixed performance. These results elucidate
a possible classification feature model that could aid in the sentiment 
analysis of Twitter feeds and other microblogging environments.
