Abstract#==#The SemEval 2016 DiMSUM Shared Task concerns the  detection of minimal semantic
units from text and prediction of their coarse lexical categories known as
supersenses. Our approach is to define this task as a binary
classification problem approachable by straightforward machine learning
methods.

We start by detecting semantic units by matching text spans against several
large dictionaries, including the English WordNet, expressions derived from the
Yelp Academic Dataset and concepts from the English Wikipedia, generating a set
of potential supersenses for each matched span. For each potential supersense
and text span pair a binary machine learning example is defined. We classify
these examples using an ensemble method, taking as the final predicted
supersense the one with the highest confidence score.

Our system achieves good performance on the supersense classification task but
has limited performance for detection of multi-word semantic units. We show
that
the task of supersense prediction can be effectively defined as a binary
classification task.
