Abstract#==#This paper describes three unsupervised systems
for determining the semantic similarity
between two short texts or sentences submitted
to the SemEval 2016 Task 1, all of which
make use of only off-the-shelf software and
data making them easy to replicate. Two
systems achieved a similar Pearson correlation
coefficient (0.64661 by simple vector, 0.65319
by word alignments). We include experiments
on using our alignment based system on evaluation
data from the 2014 and 2015 STS shared
task. The results suggest that beyond the
core similarity algorithm, other factors such as
data preprocessing and use of domain-specific
knowledge are also important to similarity
prediction performance.
