Abstract#==#This paper describes the system developed at LIF for the SemEval-2016 Task 4
evaluation campaign. The goal of the task was to identify sentiment polarity in
tweets. The system extends the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) state of the
art approach. We initialize the input representations with embeddings trained
on different units: lexical, joint lexical and part-of-speech, and joint
lexical and emoticon embeddings. Neural networks for each input space are
trained separately, and then the representations extracted from their hidden
layers are concatenated as input of a fusion neural network. The fusion system
ranked 2nd at the SemEval-2016 evaluation campaign and obtained an average F1
of 63.0%.
