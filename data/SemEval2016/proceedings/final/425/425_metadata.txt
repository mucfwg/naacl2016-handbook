Abstract#==#We propose a deep neural network based natural language processing system for
clinical information (such as time information, event spans, and their
attributes) extraction from raw clinical notes and pathology reports. Our
approach uses the context words and their part-of-speech tags and shape
information as features. We utilize the temporal (1D) convolution neural
network to learn the hidden feature representations. In prediction step, we use
the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to predict event spans. The empirical
evaluation demonstrates that our approach significantly outperforms baseline
methods.
