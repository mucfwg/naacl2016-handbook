Abstract#==#This paper presents our submissions for semantic textual similarity task in
SemEval 2016. Based on various traditional features (i.e.,  string-based,
corpus-based, machine translation similarity and alignment metrics, we leverage
word embedding from macro (i.e., first get representation of sentence, then
measure the similarity of sentence pair) and micro views (i.e., measure the
similarity of word pairs seperately) to boost performance. Due to the various
domains of training data and test data, we adopt three different strategies of
the usage of training data: 1) U-SEVEN: an unsupervised model, which utilizes
seven straight-forward metrics; 2) S1-All: use all available datasets; 3) S2:
select the most similar training sets for each test set. Results on test sets
show that a unified supervised model(i.e., S1-All) achieves the best averaged
performance with a mean correlation of 75.07%.
