Abstract#==#The complex word identification task refers to the process of identifying
difficult words in a sentence from the perspective of readers belonging to a
specific target audience. This task has immense importance in the field of
lexical simplification. Lexical simplification helps in improving the
readability of texts consisting of challenging words. As a participant of the
SemEval-2016: Task 11 shared task, we developed two systems using various
lexical and semantic features to identify complex words, one using Naive Bayes
and another based on Random Forest Classifiers. The Naive Bayes classifier
based system achieves the maximum G-score of 76.7% after incorporating rule
based post-processing techniques.
