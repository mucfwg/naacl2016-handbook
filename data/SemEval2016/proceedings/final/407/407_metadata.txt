Abstract#==#Clinical TempEval 2016 evaluated temporal information extraction systems on the
clinical domain. Nine sub-tasks were included, covering problems in time
expression identification, event expression identification and temporal
relation identification. Participant systems were trained and evaluated on a
corpus of clinical and pathology notes from the Mayo Clinic, annotated with an
extension of TimeML for the clinical domain. 14 teams submitted a total of 40
system runs, with the best systems achieving near-human performance on
identifying events and times. On identifying temporal relations, there was a
gap between the best systems and human performance, but the gap was less than
half the gap of Clinical TempEval 2015.
