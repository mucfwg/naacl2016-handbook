Abstract#==#In this paper, we report an implementation of neural network based approaches
for semantic textual similarity prediction. We leverage multi-layer
bidirectional LSTM to learn sentence representation. Then we construct matching
features followed by Highway Multilayer Perceptron to make predictions. 
Experimental results demonstrate that this approach can't get better results on
standard evaluation datasets.
