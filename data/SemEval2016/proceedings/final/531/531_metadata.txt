Abstract#==#This paper describes an experimental approach to Detection of Minimal Semantic
Units and their Meaning (DiMSUM), explored within the framework of SemEval'16
Task 10. The approach is primarily based on a combination of word embeddings
and parser-based features, and employs unidirectional incremental computation
of compositional embeddings for multiword expressions.
