Abstract#==#We introduce a word frequency-based classifier for the SemEval 2016 complex
word identification task (#11).  Words with lower frequency are predicted as
complex based on a threshold optimized for G-score.  We examine three different
corpora for calculating frequencies and find English Wikipedia to perform best
(ranked 13th on the SemEval task), followed by the Google Web Corpus and lastly
Simple English Wikipedia. Bagging is also shown to slightly improve the
performance of the classifier.                          Overall, we find word
frequency to
be a
strong
predictor of complexity.  On the SemEval "test" set, a frequency classifier
that uses the optimal frequency threshold performs on-par with the best
submitted system and a system trained using only 500 labeled examples split
from the test set achieves results that are only slightly below the best
submitted system.
