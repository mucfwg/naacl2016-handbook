Abstract#==#In this paper we describe our participation in the STS Core subtask which is
the determination of the monolingual semantic similarity between pair of
sentences.
In our participation we adapted state-of-the-art approaches from related work
applied on previous STS Core subtasks and run them on the 2016 data.
We investigated the performance of single methods but also the combination of
them.
Our results show that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are superior to both
the Monolingual Word Alignment and the Word2Vec approaches.
The combination of all the three methods performs slightly better than using
CNN only.
Our results also show that the performance of our systems varies between the
datasets.
