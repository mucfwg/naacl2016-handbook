Abstract#==#This paper describes our participation in
SemEval-2016 Task 5 for Subtask 1, Slot 2.
The challenge demands to find domain specific
target expressions on sentence level that
refer to reviewed entities. The detection of target
words is achieved by using word vectors
and its grammatical dependency relationships
to classify each word in a sentence into target
or non-target. A heuristic based function
then expands the classified target words to the
whole target phrase. Our system achieved an
F1 score of 56.816% for this task.
