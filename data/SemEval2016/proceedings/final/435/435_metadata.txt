Abstract#==#This work presents our team solution for task 4a  (Message Polarity
Classification) at the SemEval 2016 challenge. Our experiments have been
carried out over the Twitter dataset provided by the challenge. 
We follow a supervised approach, exploiting a SVM polynomial kernel classifier
trained with the challenge data.  The classifier takes as input advanced NLP
features. This paper details the features and discusses the achieved results.
