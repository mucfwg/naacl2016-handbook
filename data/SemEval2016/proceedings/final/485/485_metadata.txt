Abstract#==#This paper presents a solution to Semeval
2016 Task 14 which asks for a system that is
able to insert new lemmas into WordNet. Our
system aims to do this by overlapping words in
the definitions of the to-be-inserted lemma and
all senses in WordNet. This paper includes
the results of our system and also includes the
baseline provided by Task 14, with our system
scoring higher than the random baseline, and
lower than the first word baseline.
