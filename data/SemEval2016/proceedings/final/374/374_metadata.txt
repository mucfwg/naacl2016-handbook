Abstract#==#This paper describes the Duluth systems that participated in Task 14 of SemEval
2016, Semantic Taxonomy Enrichment. There were three related systems in the
formal evaluation which are discussed here, along with numerous
post--evaluation runs. All of these systems identified synonyms between WordNet
and other dictionaries by measuring the gloss overlaps between them. These
systems perform better than the random baseline and one post--evaluation
variation was within a respectable margin of the median result attained by all
participating systems.
