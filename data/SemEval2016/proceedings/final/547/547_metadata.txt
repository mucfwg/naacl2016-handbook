Abstract#==#This paper describes our system submission to the SemEval 2016 English Semantic
Textual Similarity (STS) shared task. The proposed system is based on the
compositional text similarity model, which aggregates pairwise word
similarities for computing the semantic similarity between texts. In addition,
our system combines word importance and word similarity to build an
importance-similarity matrix. Three different word similarity measures are used
in our three submitted runs. The evaluation results show that taking into
account context dependent word importance information improves performance.
However, the performance of the system varies drastically between different
evaluation subsets. The best of our submitted runs achieves rank 60th with
weighted mean Pearson correlation to human judgements of 0.6892.
