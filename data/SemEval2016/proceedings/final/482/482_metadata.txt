Abstract#==#We present a description of the system submitted to the Semantic Textual
Similarity (STS) shared task at SemEval 2016. The task is to assess the degree
to which two sentences carry the same meaning. We have designed two different
methods to automatically compute a similarity score between sentences. The
first method combines a variety of semantic similarity measures as features in
a machine learning model. In our second approach, we employ training data from
the Interpretable Similarity subtask to create a combined word-similarity
measure and assess the importance of both aligned and unaligned words. Finally,
we combine the two methods into a single hybrid model. Our best-performing run
attains a score of 0.7732 on the 2015 STS evaluation data and 0.7488 on the
2016 STS evaluation data.
