Abstract#==#We investigate the usage of word embeddings, namely Glove and SCODE, along with
substring features on Complex Word Identification task. We introduce two
systems: the first system utilizes the word embeddings of the target word and
its substrings as features while the other considers the context information by
using the embeddings of the surrounding words as well. Although the proposed
representations perform below the average with nonlinear models, we show that
word embeddings with substring features is an effective representation choice
when employed with linear classifiers.
