Abstract#==#Complex word identification task focuses on identifying the difficult word from
 English sentence for a Non-Native speakers. Non-Native speakers are those who
don't have English as their native language. It is a sub-task for lexical
simplification. We have experimented with word embedding features, orthographic
word features, similarity features and POS tag features which improves the
performance of the classification. In addition to the SemEval 2016 results we
have evaluated the training data by varying the vector dimension size and
obtained the best possible size for producing better performance. The SVM
learning algorithm will attains constant and maximum accuracy through linear
classifier. We achieve a G-score of 0.43 and 0.54 on computing complex words
for two systems.
