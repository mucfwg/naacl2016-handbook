Abstract#==#This paper describes the participation of the team ``TwiSE'' in the SemEval
2016 challenge.
Specifically, we participated in Task 4, namely ``Sentiment Analysis in
Twitter'' for which we implemented
sentiment classification systems for subtasks A, B, C and D.
Our approach consists of two steps. In the first step, we generate and validate
diverse  feature sets for twitter sentiment evaluation, inspired by the work of
participants of previous editions of such challenges. 
In the second step, we focus on the optimization of the evaluation measures of
the different subtasks. To this end, we examine different learning strategies
by validating them on the data provided by the task organisers. For our final
submissions we used an ensemble learning approach (stacked generalization) for
Subtask A and single linear models for the rest of the subtasks. In the
official leaderboard we were ranked 9/35, 8/19, 1/11 and 2/14 for subtasks A,
B, C and D respectively. The code can be found at
