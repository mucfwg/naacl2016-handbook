Abstract#==#We present two methods for the automatic detection of complex words in context
as
perceived by non-native English readers, for the SemEval 2016 Task 11 on
Complex Word Identification (Paetzold and Specia, 2016). The submitted systems
exploit the same set of features, but are highly disparate in (i) their earning
algorithm and (ii) their angle on the learning objective, where especially the
latter presents an effort to account for the sparsity of positive instances in
the data as well as the large disparity between the distributions of positive
instances in the training and test data.

We further present valuable insights that we gained during intensive and
extensive post-task experiments. Those revealed that despite poor results in
the task, our neural network approach is competitive with the systems achieving
the best results. The central contribution of this paper is therefore a
demonstration of the aptitude of deep neural networks for the task of
identifying complex words.
