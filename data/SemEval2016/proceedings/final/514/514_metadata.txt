Abstract#==#In this paper we describe our system (DTSim) submitted at SemEval-2016 Task 1:
Semantic Textual Similarity (STS Core). We developed Support Vector Regression
model with various features including the similarity scores calculated using
alignment based methods and semantic composition based methods. The
correlations between our system output and the human ratings were above 0.8 in
three datasets.
