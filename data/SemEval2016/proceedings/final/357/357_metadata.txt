Abstract#==#This paper describes an information-theoretic approach to complex word
identification using a classifier based on an entropy based measure based on
word senses and sentence-level perplexity features. We describe the motivation
behind these features based on information density and demonstrate that they
perform modestly well in the complex word identification task in SemEval-2016.
We also discuss the possible improvements that can be made to future work by
exploring the subjectivity of word complexity and more robust evaluation
metrics for the complex word identification task.
