Abstract#==#This paper describes our approach for the Detecting Stance in Tweets task
(SemEval-2016 Task 6). We utilized recent advances in short text categorization
using deep learning to create word-level and character-level models. The choice
between word-level and character-level models in each particular case was
informed through validation performance. Our final system is a combination of
classifiers using word-level or character-level models. We also employed novel
data augmentation techniques to expand and diversify our training dataset, thus
making our system more robust. Our system achieved a macro-average precision,
recall and F1-scores of 0.67, 0.61 and 0.635 respectively.
