Abstract#==#This paper describes the system developed for the task of temporal information
extraction from clinical narratives in the context of 2016 Clinical TempEval
challenge. Clinical TempEval 2016 addressed the problem of temporal reasoning
in clinical domain by providing annotated clinical notes and pathology reports
similar to Clinical TempEval challenge 2015. The Clinical TempEval challenge
consisted of six subtasks. Hitachi team participated in two time expression
based subtasks: time expression span detection (TS) and time expression
attribute identification (TA) for which we developed hybrid of rule-based and
machine learning based methods using Stan-ford TokensRegex framework and
Stanford Named Entity Recognizer and evaluated it on the THYME corpus. Our
hybrid system achieved a maximum F-score of 0.73 for identification of time
spans (TS) and 0.71 for identification of time attributes (TA).
