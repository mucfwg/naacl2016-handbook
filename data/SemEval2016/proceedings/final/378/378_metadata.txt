Abstract#==#This paper describes the iLab-Edinburgh Sentiment Analysis system, winner of
the Arabic Twitter Task 7 in SemEval-2016. The system employs a hybrid approach
of supervised learning and rule-based methods to predict a sentiment intensity
(SI) score for a given Arabic Twitter phrase. First, the supervised method uses
an ensemble of trained linear regression models to produce an initial SI score
for each given text instance. Second, the resulting SI score is adjusted using
a set of rules that exploit a number of publicly available sentiment lexica.
The system demonstrates strong results of 0.536 Kendall score, ranking top in
this task.
