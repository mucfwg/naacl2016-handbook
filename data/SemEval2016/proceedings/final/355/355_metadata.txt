Abstract#==#This paper describes the University of
Sheffield’s submission to the SemEval 2016
Twitter Stance Detection weakly supervised
task (SemEval 2016 Task 6, Subtask B). In
stance detection, the goal is to classify the
stance of a tweet towards a target as “favor”,
“against”, or “none”. In Subtask B, the targets
in the test data are different from the targets in
the training data, thus rendering the task more
challenging but also more realistic. To address
the lack of target-specific training data, we use
a large set of unlabelled tweets containing all
targets and train a bag-of-words autoencoder
to learn how to produce feature representations
of tweets. These feature representations
are then used to train a logistic regression classifier
on labelled tweets, with additional features
such as an indicator of whether the target
is contained in the tweet. Our submitted
run on the test data achieved an F1 of 0.3270.
