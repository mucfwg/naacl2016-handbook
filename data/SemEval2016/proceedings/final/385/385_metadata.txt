Abstract#==#This paper is a description of our system de-veloped for SemEval-2016 Task 9:
Chinese Semantic Dependency Parsing. We have built a transition-based
dependency parser with on-line reordering, which is not limited to a tree
structure and can produce 99.7% of the necessary dependencies while maintaining
linear algorithm complexity. To improve parsing quality we used additional
techniques such as pre- and post-processing of the dependency graph,
bootstrapping and a rich feature set with additional semantic features.
