Abstract#==#Semantic dependency parsing aims at extracting arcs and semantic role labels
for all words in a sentence at the same time. In this paper, we propose a
semantic dependency parser which is based on Long Short-term Memory and make
heavy use of embeddings of words and POS tags. We describe in detail the
implementation of the neural parser, including preprocessing, postprocessing
and various input features,
and show that the neural parser performs close to the top system in the shared
task and is very good at capturing non-local dependencies. We also discuss some
issues related to the parser and how to improve it.
