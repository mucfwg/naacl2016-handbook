Abstract#==#This paper describes our system participating
in the Semeval 2016 task: Detecting stance
in Tweets. The goal was to identify whether
the author of a tweet is in favor of the given
target or against. Our approach is based
on a maximum entropy classifier, which uses
surface-level, sentiment and domain-specific
features. We participated in both the supervised
and weakly supervised subtasks and received
promising results for most of the targets.
