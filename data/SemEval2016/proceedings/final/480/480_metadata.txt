Abstract#==#This paper reports our submission to the Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis task
of SemEval 2016. It covers the prediction of sentiment for a given set of
aspects (e.g., subtask 1, slot 2) for the English language using discourse
analysis. To that end, a discourse parser implementing the Rhetorical Structure
Theory is employed and the resulting information is used to determine the
context of each aspect, as well as to compute the expressed sentiment in that
context by weighing the discourse relations between words. While discourse
analysis yields high level linguistic information that can be used to better
predict sentiment, the proposed algorithm does not yet stack up to the
high-performing machine learning approaches that are commonly exploited for
this task.
