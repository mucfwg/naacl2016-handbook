Abstract#==#This paper describes our IR (Information Retrieval) 
based method for Semantic Textual Similarity (STS)
in the SemEval 2016 task 1.
The main feature of our approach is 
to extend a conventional IR-based scheme 
by incorporating word alignment results.
This enables us to develop a more fine-grained 
similarity measurement.
In the evaluation results, 
we have seen that the proposed method improves upon 
a conventional IR-based method on average.
In addition, one of our submissions achieved 
the best performance for the ``postediting'' data set.
