Abstract#==#We present a novel method for determining sentiment intensity. The main goal is
to assign a phrase a score from 0 to 1 which indicates the strength of its
association with positive sentiment. The proposed model uses a rich set of
features with Gaussian processes regression model that computes the final
score. The system was evaluated on the data from 7th task of SemEval 2016. Our
regression model trained on the development data reached Kendall rank
correlation of 0.659 on general English phrases and 0.414 on English Twitter
test data.
