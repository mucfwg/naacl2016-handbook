Abstract#==#This task combines the labeling of multiword expressions and supersenses
(coarse-grained classes) in an explicit, yet broad-coverage paradigm for
lexical semantics. Nine systems participated; the best scored 57.7% F1 in a
multi-domain evaluation setting, indicating that the task remains largely
unresolved. An error analysis reveals that a large number of instances in the
data set are either hard cases, which no systems get right, or easy cases,
which all systems correctly solve.
