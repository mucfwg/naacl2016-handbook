Abstract#==#In this paper we present our system de-
veloped for the SemEval 2016 Task 2 -
Interpretable Semantic Textual Similarity
along with the results obtained for our sub-
mitted runs. Our system participated in
the subtasks predicting chunk similarity
alignments for gold chunks as well as for
predicted chunks. The Inspire system ex-
tends the basic ideas from last years par-
ticipant NeRoSim, however we realize the
rules in logic programming and obtain the
result with an Answer Set Solver. To pre-
pare the input for the logic program, we
use the PunktTokenizer, Word2Vec, and
WordNet APIs of NLTK, and the POS-
and NER-taggers from Stanford CoreNLP.
For chunking we use a joint POS-tagger
and dependency parser and based on that
determine chunks with an Answer Set Pro-
gram. Our system ranked third place over-
all and first place in the Headlines gold
chunk subtask.
