Abstract#==#This paper presents an alternative approach to polarity and intensity
classification of sentiments in microblogs.  In contrast to previous
works, which either relied on carefully designed hand-crafted feature
sets or automatically derived neural embeddings for words, our method
harnesses character embeddings as its main input units.  We obtain
task-specific vector representations of characters by training a deep
multi-layer convolutional neural network on the labeled dataset
provided to the participants of the SemEval-2016 Shared Task 4
*Sentiment Analysis in Twitter; Nakov, 2016) and subsequently evaluate
our classifiers on subtasks B (two-way polarity classification) and C
(joint five-way prediction of polarity and intensity) of this
competition.  Our first system, which uses three manifold convolution
sets followed by four non-linear layers, ranks 16 in the former track;
while our second network, which consists of a single convolutional
filter set followed by a highway layer and three non-linearities with
linear mappings in-between, attains the 10-th place on subtask C.
