Abstract#==#In this paper, we compare feature-based and Neural Network-based approaches on
the supervised stance classification task for tweets in SemEval-2016 Task 6
Subtask A (Mohammad et al., 2016). In the feature-based approach, we use
external resources such as lexicons and crawled texts. The Neural Network based
approach employs Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Our results show that the
feature-based model outperformed the CNN model on the test data although the
CNN model was better than the feature-based model in the cross validation on
the training data.
