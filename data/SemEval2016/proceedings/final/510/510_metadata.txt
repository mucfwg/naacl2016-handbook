Abstract#==#In this paper we consider several approaches to predicting semantic textual
similarity using word embeddings, as well as methods for forming embeddings for
larger units of text. We compare these methods to several baselines, and find
that none of them outperform the baselines. We then consider both a supervised
and unsupervised approach to combining these methods which achieve modest
improvements over the baselines.
