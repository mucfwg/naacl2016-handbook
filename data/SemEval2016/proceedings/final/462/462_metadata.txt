Abstract#==#This paper describes our deep learning-based approach to sentiment analysis in
Twitter as part of SemEval-2016 Task 4. We use a convolutional neural network
to determine sentiment and participate in all subtasks, i.e. two-point,
three-point, and five-point scale sentiment classification and two-point and
five-point scale sentiment quantification. We achieve competitive results for
two-point scale sentiment classification and quantification, ranking fifth and
a close fourth (third and second by alternative metrics) respectively despite
using only pre-trained embeddings that contain no sentiment information. We
achieve good performance on three-point scale sentiment classification, ranking
eighth out of 35, while performing poorly on five-point scale sentiment
classification and quantification. An error analysis reveals that this is due
to low expressiveness of the model to capture negative sentiment as well as an
inability to take into account ordinal information. We propose improvements in
order to address these and other issues.
