Abstract#==#This paper describes our system for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA),
task 5 of SemEval 2016. To conduct sentence level ABSA, we employed minimally
supervised approaches for each type of extracted information. The system uses
Word2Vec to derive word semantic similarities, and relies on external
review corpora as training data. The results of the 2016 evaluation are
discussed and suggestions for improvements are given.
