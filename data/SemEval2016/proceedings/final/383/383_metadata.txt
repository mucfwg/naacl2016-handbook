Abstract#==#This paper describes the system submitted by IHS-RD-Belarus team for the
sentiment detection polarity subtask on Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis task at
the SemEval 2016 workshop on semantic evaluation. We tried an approach to
the polarity detection task based on an artificial neural network. Evaluation
on the test data set showed that our system achieved the F-score of 0.83 for
restaurants domain (rank 4 out of 28 submissions) and F-score of 0.78 for
laptops domain (rank 4 out of 21 submissions).
