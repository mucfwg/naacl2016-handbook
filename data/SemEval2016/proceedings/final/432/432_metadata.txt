Abstract#==#This paper describes the system that was submitted to SemEval2016 Task 11:
Complex Word Identification. It presents a preliminary investigation into
exploring word difficulty for non-native English speakers. We developed two
systems using Nearest Centroid Classification technique to distinguish complex
words from simple words. Optimized over G-score, the presented solution
obtained a G-score of 0.67, while the winner achieved a G-score of 0.77 and the
average G-score of all the submitted systems in the task was 0.56.
