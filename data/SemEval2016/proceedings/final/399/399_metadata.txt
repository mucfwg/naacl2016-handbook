Abstract#==#This paper introduces our Chinese semantic dependency parsing system for Task 9
of SemEval 2016. 
 Our system has two components: a parser trained by Berkeley Grammar Trainer on
the Penn Chinese Treebank reannotated in a Generalized Categorial Grammar, and
a multinomial logistic regression classifier. We first parse the data with the
automatic parser to obtain predicate-argument dependencies and then we use the
classifier to predict the semantic dependency labels for the predicate-argument
dependency relations extracted. Although our parser is not trained directly on
the task training data, our system yields the best performance for the
non-local dependency recovery for the news data and comparable overall results.
