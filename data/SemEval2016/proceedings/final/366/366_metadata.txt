Abstract#==#In this paper, we propose a deep learning system for classification of tweets
on a two-point scale. Our architecture consists of a multilayered recurrent
neural network having gated recurrent units. The network is pre-trained with a
weakly labeled dataset of tweets to learn the sentiment specific embeddings.
Then it is fine tuned on the given training dataset of the task 4B in
SemEval-2016. The network does very little pre-processing for raw tweets and no
post-processing at all. The proposed system achieves 3rd rank on the
leaderboard of task 4B.
