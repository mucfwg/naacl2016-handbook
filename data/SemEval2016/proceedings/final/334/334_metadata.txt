Abstract#==#This paper describes iUBC: a RNN and LSTM based approach that achieves 
competitive results on the interpretable STS task (iSTS 2016). Actually, it
achieves top performance in one of the three datasets. iUBC makes use of a
jointly trained classifier and regressor, and both models work on top of a
recurrent neural network. Through the paper we provide detailed description of
the approach, as well as the results obtained in iSTS 2015 test, iSTS 2016
training and iSTS 2016 test.
