Abstract#==#This paper describes the SimiHawk system submission from UMass Lowell for the
core Semantic Textual Similarity task at SemEval-2016. We built four systems: a
small feature-based system that leverages word alignment and machine
translation quality evaluation metrics, two end-to-end LSTM-based systems, and
an ensemble system. The LSTM-based systems used either a simple LSTM
architecture or a Tree-LSTM structure. We found that of the three base systems,
the feature-based model obtained the best results, outperforming each
LSTM-based model's correlation by .06. Ultimately, the ensemble system was able
to outperform it substantially, obtaining a weighted Pearson correlation of
0.738, and placing 7th out of 115 participating systems. We find that the
ensemble system's success comes largely from its ability to form a consensus
and eliminate complementary noise from its base systems' predictions.
