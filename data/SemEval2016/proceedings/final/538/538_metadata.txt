Abstract#==#Manually constructed taxonomies provide a crucial resource for many NLP
technologies, yet these resources are often limited in their lexical coverage
due to their construction procedure.  
While multiple approaches have been proposed to enrich such taxonomies with new
concepts, these techniques are typically evaluated by measuring the accuracy at
identifying relationships between words, e.g., that a dog is a canine, rather
relationships between specific concepts. 
Task 14 provides an evaluation framework for automatic taxonomy enrichment
techniques by measuring the placement of a new concept into an existing
taxonomy: Given a new word and its definition, systems were asked to attach or
merge the concept into an existing WordNet concept.
Five teams submitted 13 systems to the task, all of which were able to improve
over the random baseline system. 
However, only one participating system outperformed the second,
more-competitive baseline that attaches a new term to the first word in its
gloss with the appropriate part of speech, which indicates that techniques must
be adapted to exploit the structure of glosses.
