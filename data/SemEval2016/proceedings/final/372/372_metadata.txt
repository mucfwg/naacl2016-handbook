Abstract#==#This paper describes a sentiment analysis system developed by the bunji team in
SemEval-2016 Task 5. In this task, we estimate the sentimental polarity of a
given entity-attribute (E#A) pair in a sentence. Our approach is to estimate
the relationship between target entities and sentimental expressions. We use
two different methods to estimate the relationship. The first one is based on a
neural attention model that learns relations between tokens and E#A pairs
through backpropagation. The second one is based on a rule-based system that
examines several verb-centric relations related to E#A pairs. We confirmed the
effectiveness of the proposed methods in a target estimation task and a
polarity estimation task in the restaurant domain, while our overall ranks were
modest.
