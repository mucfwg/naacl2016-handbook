Abstract#==#We use referential translation machines (RTMs) for predicting the semantic
similarity of text in both STS Core and Cross-lingual STS.
RTMs pioneer a language independent approach to all similarity tasks and remove
the need to access any task or domain 
specific information or resource. RTMs become 14th out of 26 submissions in
Cross-lingual STS. 
We also present rankings of various prediction tasks using the performance of
RTM in terms of MRAER, 
a normalized relative absolute error metric.
