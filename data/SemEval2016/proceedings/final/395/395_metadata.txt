Abstract#==#Community question answering platforms need to automatically rank answers and
questions with respect to a given question. In this paper, we present the
approaches for the Answer Selection and Question Retrieval tasks of
SemEval-2016 (task 3). We develop a bag-of-vectors approach with various
vector- and text-based features, and different neural network approaches
including CNNs and LSTMs to capture the semantic similarity between questions
and answers for ranking purpose. Our evaluation demonstrates that our
approaches significantly outperform the baselines.
