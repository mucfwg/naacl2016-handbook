Abstract#==#VRep is a system designed for SemEval 2016 Task 1 - Semantic Textual Similarity
(STS) and Task 2 - Interpretable Semantic Textual Similarity (iSTS). STS
quantifies the semantic equivalence between two snippets of text, and iSTS
provides a reason why those snippets of text are similar. VRep makes extensive
use of WordNet for both STS, where the Vector relatedness measure is used, and
for iSTS, where features are extracted to create a learned rule-based
classifier. This paper outlines the VRep algorithm, provides results from the
2016 SemEval competition, and analyzes the performance contributions of the
system components.
