Abstract#==#This paper describes team MAZA entries for the 2016 SemEval Task 11: Complex
Word Identification (CWI). The task is a binary classification task in which
systems are trained to predict whether a word in a sentence is considered to be
complex or not. We developed our two systems for this task based on classifier
stacking using decision stumps and decision trees. Our best system, using
contextual features, frequency information, and word and sentence length,
achieved 91.2% accuracy and 30.8% F-Score. The system ranked 4th among the 38
entries in the CWI task in terms of F-Score.
