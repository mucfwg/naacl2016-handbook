Abstract#==#This document discusses SemEval-2016 Task 4 “Sentiment Analysis in
Twitter”, a continuation of SemEval-2013 Task 2, SemEval-2014 Task 9, and
SemEval-2015 Task 10. SemEval-2016 Task 4 comprises five subtasks, three of
which represent a significant departure from previous editions. The three new
subtasks focus, individually or in combination, on two variants of the basic
“sentiment classification in Twitter” task that had not been previously
explored within SemEval. The first variant adopts a five-point scale, which
confers an ordinal character to the classification task. The second variant
focuses on the correct estimation of the prevalence of each class of interest,
a task which has been called quantification in the supervised learning
literature. In contrast, previous years’ subtasks have focused on the correct
labelling of individual tweets. The task attracted a total of 43 teams.
