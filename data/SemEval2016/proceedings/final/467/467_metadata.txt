Abstract#==#We participate in the English subtask B and C at SemEval-2016 Task 3
“Community Question Answering”. This paper is concerned with the
description of our participating system. We propose a ranking model that
combines a translation model with the cosine similarity-based method. Compared
to the traditional bag of words method, the proposed model is more effective
because the relationships between words can be explicitly modeled through
word-to-word translation probabilities. Experiments conducted on the official
test data demonstrate that our proposed ranking method obtains promising
results.
