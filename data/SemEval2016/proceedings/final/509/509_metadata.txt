Abstract#==#We present the INESC-ID system for the 2016 edition of SemEval Twitter
Sentiment Analy- sis shared task (subtask 4-A). The system was based on the
Non-Linear Sub-space Embed- ding (NLSE) model developed for last year’s
competition. This model trains a projection of pre-trained embeddings into a
small sub- space using the supervised data available. De- spite its simplicity,
the system attained perfor- mances comparable to the best systems of last
edition with no need for feature engineering. One limitation of this model was
the assump- tion that a pre-trained embedding was avail- able for every word.
In this paper, we investi- gated different strategies to overcome this lim-
itation by exploiting character-level embed- dings and learning representations
for out-of- embedding vocabulary words. The resulting approach outperforms our
previous model by a relatively small margin, while still attaining strong
results and a consistent good perfor- mance across all the evaluation datasets.
