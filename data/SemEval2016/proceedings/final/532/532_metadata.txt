Abstract#==#Sentiment analysis of tweets has attracted considerable attentions recently for
potential use in commercial and public sector applications. Typical sentiment
analysis classifies the sentiment of sentences into several discrete classes
(e.g., positive and negative). For Task 4 subtask C of SemEval-2016, the aim is
to classify the sentiment of tweets into an ordinal five-point scale. In this
paper, we presents a system that uses word embeddings and recurrent
convolutional network for this competition. The word embeddings provide a
continuous vector representation of words for the recurrent convolutional
network to build sentence vectors for multi-point classification. The results
show that the proposed method achieved the second rank among eleven teams for
micro-averaged MAE (mean absolute error) and eighth rank for macro-averaged
MAE.
