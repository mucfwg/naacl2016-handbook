Abstract#==#This paper presents our system submitted for SemEval 2016 Task 10: Detecting
Minimal Semantic Units and their Meanings (DiMSUM). We extend AMALGrAM
(Schneider and Smith, 2015) by tapping two additional information sources. The
first information source uses a semantic knowledge base (YAGO3; Suchanek et
al., 2007) to improve supersense tagging (SST) for named entities.
The second information source employs word embeddings (GloVe; Pennington et
al., 2014) to capture fine-grained latent semantics and therefore improving the
supersense identification for both nouns and verbs. We conduct a detailed
evaluation and error analysis for our features and come to the conclusion that
both our extensions lead to an improved detection for SST.
