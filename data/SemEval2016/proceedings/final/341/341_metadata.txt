Abstract#==#This paper presents the description of a system which detects complex words. It
solely uses information regarding the presence of a word in a prepared
vocabulary list. The system outperforms multiple more advanced systems and is
ranked fourth for the shared task, with minimal loss to the best system.
F-score optimization guaranteed the first place in this measurement. Different
features are considered and evaluated. Maximal bounds are predicted. The rule
``the simplest methods give the best results'' is confirmed.
