Abstract#==#We describe a set of systems submitted to the SemEval-2016 English Semantic
Textual Similarity (STS) task. Given two English sentences, the task is to
compute the degree of their semantic similarity. Each of our systems uses the
SemEval 2012--2015 STS datasets to train a ridge regression model that combines
different measures of similarity. Our best system demonstrates 73.6%
correlation with average human annotations across five test sets.
