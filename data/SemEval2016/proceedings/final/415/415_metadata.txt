Abstract#==#This paper describes aggregated learning models for Complex Word Identification
(CWI) task in SemEval 2016. The work focused on selecting the features that
determine complexity of words and used different combinations of support vector
machine (SVM) and decision tree (DT) techniques for classification. These
classifiers were pipelined with pre-processing and postprocessing blocks which
helped improving accuracy of systems, though had little impact on recall. Four
systems were evaluated on the test set; SVM and DT systems by team Bhasha
achieved G score of 0.529 and 0.508 respectively and SVM&DT and SVMPP systems
by team Garuda achieved G scores of 0.360 and 0.546 respectively.
