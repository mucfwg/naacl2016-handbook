Abstract#==#This paper describes our sentiment classification system for
microblog sized documents and documents where a topic
is present. The system consisted of a soft-voting ensemble
of a word2vec language model adapted to classification, a
convolutional neural network (CNN) and a long-short term
memory network (LSTM). Our main contribution consists
of a way to introduce topic information into this model, by
concatenating a topic embedding, consisting of the averaged
word embedding for that topic, to each word embedding
vector in our neural networks. By comparing our models on
SemEval 2016 task 4 subtasks A and B, we demonstrate that
the ensemble performed better than any single classifier, and
our method of including topic information achieves a signif-
icant performance gain. According to results on the official
test sets, our model ranked 3rd for F PN in the message-
only subtask A (among 34 teams) and 1st for accuracy on
the topic-dependent subtask B (among 19 teams).
