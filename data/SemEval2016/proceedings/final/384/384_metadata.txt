Abstract#==#This paper describes the system by FBK HLT-MT for cross-lingual semantic
textual similarity measurement. Our approach is based on supervised regression
with an ensemble decision tree. In order to assign a semantic similarity score
to an input sentence pair, the model combines features collected by
state-of-the-art
methods in machine translation quality estimation and distance metrics between
cross-lingual embeddings of the two sentences. In our analysis, we compare
different techniques for composing sentence vectors, several distance features
and ways to produce training data. The proposed system achieves a mean
Pearsonâ€™s correlation of 0.39533, ranking 7th among all participants in the
cross-lingual
STS task organized within the SemEval 2016 evaluation campaign.
