Abstract#==#We present in this paper a system for measuring Semantic Text Similarity (STS)
in English. We introduce three novel techniques: the use of Types, methods of
linking phrases and the use of a Surprise Factor to generate 8,370 similarity
measures, which we then combine using Support Vector and Kernel Ridge
Regression. Our system out performs the State of the Art in SemEval 2015 and
our best performing run achieved a score of .7094 on the 2016 test set as a
whole, and over 0.8 on the majority of the datasets. Additionally, the use of
Surprise, Types and phrase linking is not limited to STS and can be used across
various Natural Language Processing tasks, while our method of combining scores
provides a flexible way of combining variously generated Similarity Scores.
