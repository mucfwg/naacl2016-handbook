Abstract#==#This paper describes the participation of the TALN team in SemEval-2016 Task
14: Semantic Taxonomy Enrichment. The purpose of the task is to find the best
point of attachment in WordNet for a set of Out of Vocabulary (OOV) terms.
These may come, to name a few, from domain specific glossaries, slang or
typical jargon from Internet forums and chatrooms. Our contribution takes as
input an OOV term, its part of speech and its associated definition, and
generates a set of WordNet synset candidates derived from modelling the term's
definition as a sense embedding representation. We leverage a BabelNet-based
vector space representation, which allows us to map the algorithm's prediction
to WordNet. Our approach is designed to be generic and fitting to any domain,
without exploiting, for instance, html markup in source web pages. Our system
performs above the median of all submitted systems, and rivals in performance a
powerful baseline based on extracting the first word of the definition with the
same part-of-speech as the OOV term.
