Abstract#==#We report the findings of the Complex Word Identification task of SemEval 2016.
To create a dataset, we conduct a user study with 400 non-native English
speakers, and find that complex words tend to be rarer, less ambiguous and
shorter. A total of 42 systems were submitted from 21 distinct teams, and nine
baselines were provided. The results highlight the effectiveness of Decision
Trees and Ensemble methods for the task, but ultimately reveal that word
frequencies remain the most reliable predictor of word complexity.
