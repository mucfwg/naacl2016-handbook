Abstract#==#Semantic Textual Similarity measures similarity between pair of texts, even
though the similar context is projected using different words. This work
attempted to incorporate the context space of the sentence from that sentence
alone. It proposes combination of Word2Vec and Non-Negative Matrix
Factorization to represent the sentence as context embedding vector in context
space. Distance and correlation values between context embedding vector pairs
used as a features for Support Vector Regression to built the domain
independent similarity measuring model. The proposed model yielding performance
0.41 in terms of correlation.
