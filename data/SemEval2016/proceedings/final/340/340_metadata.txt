Abstract#==#We present the description of our submission to SemEval-2016 Task 2, for the
sub-task of aligning pre-annotated chunks between sentence pairs and providing
similarity and relatedness labels for the alignment.  The objective of the task
is to provide interpretable semantic textual similarity assessments by adding
an explanatory layer to aligned chunks. We analysed the provided datasets,
considering lexical overlap, the part of speech tags and the synonyms of the
words in the chunks, and developed a rule-based system reflecting that
analysis.  Our system performance indicates that when sentence pairs are
similar, alignment of chunks can be performed fairly well using lexical
information alone without syntactic or semantic analysis.  The advantage of our
system is that we can easily trace when chunks are aligned.
