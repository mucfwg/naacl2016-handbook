Abstract#==#Sentiment analysis has become a well-established task in Natural Language
Processing. As such, a high variety of methods have been proposed to tackle it,
for different types of texts, text levels, languages, domains and formality
levels.  Although state-of-the-art systems have obtained promising results, a
big challenge that still remains is to port the systems to the “real world”
– i.e. to implement systems that are running around the clock, dealing with
information of heterogeneous nature, from different domains, written in
different styles and diverse in formality levels. 
The present paper describes our efforts to implement such a system, using a
variety of strategies to homogenize the input and comparing various approaches
to tackle the task. Specifically, we are tackling the task using two different
approaches: a) one that is unsupervised, based on dictionaries of
sentiment-bearing words and heuristics to compute final polarity of the text
considered; b) the second, supervised, trained on previously annotated data
from different domains. For both approaches, the data is first normalized and
the slang is replaced with its expanded version.
