Abstract#==#This paper describes our contribution to the SemEval 2016 Workshop, Shared Task
8 on Meaning Representation parsing. We used a transition-based approach, which
builds upon an existing system which we attempted to improve by using a
Feedforward Neural Network classifier and an enriched feature set.
