Abstract#==#We present the description of the LTG entry in the SemEval-2016 Complex Word
Identification (CWI) task, which aimed to develop systems for identifying
complex words in English sentences. Our entry focused on the use of contextual
language model features and the application of ensemble classification methods.
Both of our systems achieved good performance, ranking in 2nd and 3rd place
overall in terms of F-Score.
