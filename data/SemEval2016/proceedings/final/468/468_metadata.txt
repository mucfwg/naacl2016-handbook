Abstract#==#This paper describes the second edition of the shared task on Taxonomy
Extraction Evaluation organised as part of SemEval 2016. This task aims to
extract hypernym-hyponym relations between a given list of domain-specific
terms and then to construct a domain taxonomy based on them. TExEval-2
introduced a multilingual setting for this task, covering four different
languages including English, Dutch, Italian and French from domains as diverse
as environment, food and science. A total of 62 runs submitted by 5 different
teams were evaluated using structural measures, by comparison with gold
standard taxonomies and by manual quality assessment of novel relations.
