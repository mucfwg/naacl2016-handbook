Abstract#==#SemEval 2016 task 11 involved determining whether words in a sentence were
complex or simple for a cohort of people
  with English as a second language.  Training data consisted of 200 annotated
sentences, representing the combined
  judgements of 20 human annotators, such that if any annotator of the group
labelled a word as complex, then it was
  considered to be complex.  Testing was based on single annotator judgements.
  Our system used a random forest classifier with a variety of features, the
most important of which were term frequency
  statistics garnered from four large corpora, and style lexicons built on two
large corpora.              Minor features in the final system include the presence
or
absence of words in various readability word lists; many other features we
tried were not successful.
  Our ranking amongst submitted systems did not reflect the strength of our
system, due to submitting a far from optimal
  weighting between complex and simple, but we show that when a more
appropriate weighting is used, our system ranks amongst the best
  submitted systems.
