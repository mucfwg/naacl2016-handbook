Abstract#==#In this paper, we apply a synchronous-graph-grammar-based approach to
SemEval-2016 Task 8, Meaning Representation Parsing. In particular, we learn
Synchronous Hyperedge Replacement Grammar (SHRG) rules from given aligned
sentence, AMR graph pairs. Then we use Earley algorithm with cube-pruning for
AMR parsing given new sentences and the learned SHRG. Experiments on the
evaluation dataset demonstrate that comparable results can be achieved using a
SHRG-based approach.
