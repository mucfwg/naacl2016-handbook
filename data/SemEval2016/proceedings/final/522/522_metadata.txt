Abstract#==#We describe the system used in our participation in the AMR Parsing task 8 for
SemEval 2016. Our parser does not rely on a syntactic pre-parse, or heavily
engineered features, and uses five recurrent neural networks as the key
architectural components for estimating AMR graph structure.
