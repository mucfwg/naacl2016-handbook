Abstract#==#This paper describes our submissions to the
Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis task of
SemEval-2016. For Aspect Category Detection
(Subtask1/Slot1), we used multiple ensembles,
based on Support Vector Machine
classifiers. For Opinion Target Expression
extraction (Subtask1/Slot2), we used a sequence
labeling approach with Conditional
Random Fields. For Polarity Detection (Subtask1/
Slot3), we used an ensemble of two supervised
classifiers, one based on hand crafted
features and one based on word embeddings.
Our systems were ranked in the top 6 positions
in all the tasks we participated. The source
code of our systems is publicly available.
