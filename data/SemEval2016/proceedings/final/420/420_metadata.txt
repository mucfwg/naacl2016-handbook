Abstract#==#Stance classification aims to identify, for a particular issue under
discussion, whether the speaker or author of a conversational turn has
Pro (Favor) or Con (Against) stance on the issue. Detecting stance in
tweets is a new task proposed for SemEval-2016 Task6, involving
predicting stance for a dataset of tweets on the topics of abortion,
atheism, climate change, feminism and Hillary Clinton.                               
     

Given
the
small size of the dataset, our team created our own
topic-specific training corpus by developing a set of high precision
hashtags for each topic that were used to query the twitter API, with
the aim of developing a large training corpus without additional
human labeling of tweets for stance. The hashtags selected
for each topic were predicted to be stance-bearing on their
own. Experimental results demonstrate good performance for our
features for opinion-target pairs based on generalizing dependency
features using sentiment lexicons.
