Abstract#==#In this paper, we demonstrate our approach for identification of events, time
expressions and temporal relations among them. This work was carried out as
part of SemEval-2016 Challenge Task 12: Clinical TempEval. The task comprises
six sub-tasks: identification of event spans, time spans and their attributes,
document time relation and the narrative container relations among events and
time expressions. We have participated in all six sub-tasks. We have provided
with a manually annotated dataset which comprises of training dataset (293
documents), development dataset (147 documents) and 151 documents as test
dataset. We have submitted our work as two systems for the challenge. One
system is developed using machine learning techniques, Conditional Random
Fields (CRF) and Support Vector machines (SVM) and the other system is
developed using deep neural network (DNN) techniques. The results show that
both systems have given relatively same performance on these tasks.
