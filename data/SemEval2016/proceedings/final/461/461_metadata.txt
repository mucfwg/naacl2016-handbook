Abstract#==#This paper describes the system for rating the degree of semantic equivalence
between two text snippets developed by team IHS-RD-Belarus for the SemEval 2016
STS shared task (Task 1). To predict the human ratings of text similarity we
use a support vector regression model with multiple features representing
similarity and difference scores calculated for each pair of sentences.
