Abstract#==#This paper describes our submissions to Task 6, i.e., Detecting Stance in
Tweets, in SemEval 2016, which aims at detecting the stance of tweets towards
given target. There are three stance labels: Favor (directly or indirectly by
supporting given target), Against (directly or indirectly by opposing or
criticizing given target), and None (none of the above). To address this task,
we present a two-step learning system, which performs two steps, i.e.,
relevance detection and orientation detection, in a pipeline-based processing
procedure. Our system ranked the 5th among 19 teams.
