Abstract#==#We introduce the SV000gg systems: two Ensemble Methods for the Complex Word
Identification task of SemEval 2016. While the SV000gg-Hard system exploits
basic Hard Voting, the SV000gg-Soft system employs Performance-Oriented Soft
Voting, which weights votes according to the voter's performance rather than
its prediction confidence, allowing for completely heterogeneous systems to be
combined. Our performance comparison shows that our voting techniques
outperform traditional Soft Voting, as well as other systems submitted to the
shared task, ranking first and second overall.
