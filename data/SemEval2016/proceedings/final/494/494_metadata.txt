Abstract#==#We present our supervised sentiment classification system which competed in
SemEval-2016 Task 4: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter. Our system employs a
Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier trained using a number of features
including n-grams, synset expansions, various sentiment scores, word clusters,
and term centroids. Using weighted SVMs, to address the issue of class
imbalance, our system obtains positive class F-scores of 0.694 and 0.650, and
negative class F-scores of 0.391 and 0.493 over the training and test sets,
respectively.
