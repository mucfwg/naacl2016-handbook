Abstract#==#In this paper we describe our deep learning approach for solving both two-,
three- and five-class tweet polarity classification, and two- and five-class
quantification. We first trained a convolutional neural network using
pretrained Twitter word embeddings, so that we could extract the hidden
activation values from the hidden layers once some input had been fed to the
network. These values were then used as features for a support vector machine
in both the classification and quantification subtasks, together with
additional linguistic information in the former scenario. The results obtained
for the classification subtasks show that this approach performs better than a
single convolutional network, and for the quantification part it also yields
good results. Official rankings locate us: 2nd (practically tied with 1st) for
the binary classification task, 2nd for binary quantification and 4th
(practically tied with 3rd) for the five-class polarity classification
challenge.
