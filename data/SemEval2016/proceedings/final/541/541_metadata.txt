Abstract#==#In this paper, a system for semantic textual similarity, which participated in
Task-1 in SemEval 2016 (monolingual and cross-lingual sub-tasks) is described.
The system contains a preprocessing step that simplifies text using PPDB 2.0
and detects negations. Also, six lexical similarity functions were constructed
using string matching, word embedding and synonyms-antonyms relations in
WordNet. These lexical similarity functions are projected to sentence level
using a new method called Polarized Soft Cardinality that supports negative
similarities between words to model opposites. We also introduce a novel
$L^{2}$-norm “cardinality” for vector space representations. The system
extracts a set of 660 features from each pair of text snippets using the
proposed cardinality measures. From this set, a subset of 12 features was
selected in a supervised manner. These features are combined by SVR and,
alternatively, by using the arithmetic mean to produce similarity predictions.
Our team ranked second in the cross-lingual sub-task and got close to the best
official results in the monolingual sub-task.
