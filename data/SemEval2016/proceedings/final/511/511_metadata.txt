Abstract#==#A growing body of research has recently been conducted on semantic textual
similarity using a variety of neural network models. While recent research
focuses on word-based representation for phrases, sentences and even
paragraphs, this study considers an alternative approach based on character
n-grams. We generate embeddings for character n-grams using a
continuous-bag-of-n-grams neural network model. Three different sentence
representations based on n-gram embeddings are considered. Results are reported
for experiments with bigram, trigram and 4-gram embeddings on the STS Core
dataset for SemEval-2016 Task 1.
