Abstract#==#We describe our submission system to the
SemEval-2016 Task 8 on Abstract Meaning
Representation (AMR) Parsing. We attempt
to improve AMR parsing by exploiting prepo-
sition semantic role labeling information re-
trieved from a multi-layer feed-forward neu-
ral network. Prepositional semantics is in-
cluded as features into the transition-based
AMR parsing system CAMR (Wang, Xue, and
S. Pradhan 2015a). The inclusion of the fea-
tures modifies the behavior of CAMR when
creating meaning representations triggered by
prepositional semantics. Despite the useful-
ness of preposition semantic role labeling in-
formation for AMR parsing, it does not have
an impact to the parsing F-score of CAMR,
but reduces the parsing recall by 1%.
