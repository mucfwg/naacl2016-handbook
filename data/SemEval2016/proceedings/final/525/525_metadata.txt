Abstract#==#This paper describes the system we submitted
to the task 3 (Community Question Answering)
in SemEval 2016, which contains
three subtasks, i.e., Question-Comment Similarity
(subtask A), Question-Question Similarity
(subtask B), and Question-External Comment
Similarity (subtask C). For subtask A,
we employed three different methods to rank
question-comment pair, i.e., supervised model
using traditional features, Convolutional Neural
Network and Long-Short Term Memory
Network. For subtask B, we proposed two
novel methods to improve semantic similarity
estimation between question-question pair by
integrating the rank information of question comment
pair. For subtask C, we implemented
a two-step strategy to select out the similar
questions and filter the unrelated comments
with respect to the original question.
