Abstract#==#This paper presents an approach for estimating the question-question similarity
of an English dataset specified in Shared Task 3, subtask B of SemEval-2016.
Given a new question and a set of the first 10 related questions retrieved by a
search engine, participants are asked to produce a binary relevant/irrelevant
judgement and rerank the related questions according to their similarity with
respect to the original question. Our submitted system uses a 2-layer
feed-forward neural network with the averages of word embedding vectors to
predict the semantic similarity score of two questions. We also evaluate the
results of Random Forests and Support Vector Machine in comparison to the
Neural Network. Results on the test dataset show that the model achieves a Mean
Average Precision 69.681.
