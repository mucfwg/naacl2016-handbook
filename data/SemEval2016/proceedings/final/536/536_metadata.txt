Abstract#==#This paper reports our submissions to Task 4, i.e., Sentiment Analysis in
Twitter (SAT), in SemEval 2016, which consists of five subtasks grouped into
two levels: (1) sentence level, i.e., message polarity classification (subtask
A), and (2) topic level, i.e., tweet classification and quantification
according to two-point scale (subtask B and D) or five-point scale (subtask C
and E). We participated in all these five subtasks. To address these subtasks,
we investigated several traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) features
including sentiment lexicon, linguistic and domain specific features, and word
embedding features together with supervised machine learning methods.
Officially released results showed that our systems rank above average.
