Abstract#==#This paper describes our approach to build a language-independent hypernym
extraction system, based on two modules for the SemEval-2016 Task 13 on
Taxonomy Extraction Evaluation (TExEval-2). This task focuses only on the
hypernym-hyponym relation extraction from a list of terms collected from
various domains and languages. The first module of our system is built on the
state-of-the-art system using BabelNet while the second one deals with the
parts found within terms and which are useful to establish a hierarchical
relation among them. Our system performed well in terms of recall in most of
the domains irrespective of the languages; however, the precision scores
indicate a scope of improvement. In case of overall ranking, our present system
stands fourth in monolingual (i.e. English) evaluation and second in
multilingual (i.e. Dutch, Italian, French) setup.
