Abstract#==#This paper describes our system for aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA). We 
participate in Subtask 1 (sentence-level ABSA), focusing specifically on aspect
category detection. We train a binary classifier for each category. This year's
addition of multiple languages makes language-independent approaches
attractive. We propose to utilize neural networks which should be capable of
discovering linguistic patterns in the data automatically, thereby reducing the
need for language-specific tools and feature engineering.
