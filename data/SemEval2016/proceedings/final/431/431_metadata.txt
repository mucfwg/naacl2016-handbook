Abstract#==#In our paper we present our rule-based system for semantic processing. In
particular we show examples and solutions that may be challenge our approach.
We then discuss problems and shortcomings of Task 2 – iSTS. We comment on the
existence of a tension between the inherent need to on the one side, to make
the task as much as possible “semantically feasible”. Whereas the detailed
presentation and some notes in the guidelines refer to inferential processes,
paraphrases and the use of commonsense knowledge of the world for the
interpretation to work. We then present results and some conclusions.
