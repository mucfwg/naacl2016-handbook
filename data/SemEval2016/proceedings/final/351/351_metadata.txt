Abstract#==#In this work, we apply classifier fusion to tweet polarity identification
problem. The task is to predict whether the emotion hidden in a tweet is
positive, neutral, or negative. An asymmetric SIMPLS (ASIMPLS) based
classifier, which was proved to be able to identify the minority class well in
imbalanced classification problems, is implemented. Word embedding is also
employed as a new feature. For each word, we obtain three word embedding
vectors on positive, neutral, and negative tweet sets respectively. These
vectors are used as features in the ASIMPLS classifier. Another three
state-of-the-art systems are implemented also, and these four systems are fused
together to further boost the performance. The fusion system achieved 59.63%
accuracy on the 2016 test set of SemEval2016 Task 4, Subtask A.
