Abstract#==#We present a supervised system that uses lexical, sentiment, semantic
dictionaries and latent and frame semantic features to identify the stance of a
tweeter towards an ideological target. We evaluate the performance of the
proposed system on subtask A in SemEval-2016 Task 6: “Detecting Stance in
Tweets”. The system yields an average F-score of 63.6% on the task’s test
set and has been ranked the 6th by the task organizers out of 19 judged
systems.
