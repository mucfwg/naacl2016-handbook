Abstract#==#This paper describes our deep learning-based approach to multilingual
aspect-based sentiment analysis as part of SemEval 2016 Task 5. We use a
convolutional neural network (CNN) for both aspect extraction and aspect-based
sentiment analysis. We cast aspect extraction as a multi-label classification
problem, outputting probabilities over aspects parameterized by a threshold. To
determine the sentiment towards an aspect, we concatenate an aspect vector with
every word embedding and apply a convolution over it.
Our system achieves competitive results across all languages and domains,
placing first or second in 5 and 7 out of 11 language-domain pairs for aspect
extraction and sentiment analysis respectively, thereby demonstrating the
viability of a deep learning-based approach for multilingual aspect-based
sentiment analysis.
