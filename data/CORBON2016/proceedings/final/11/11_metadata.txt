Abstract#==#This paper presents a quantitative and qualitative error analysis of Russian
anaphora resolvers which participated in the RU-EVAL event. Its aim is to
identify and characterize a set of challenging errors common to
state-of-the-art systems dealing with Russian. We examined three types of
pronouns: 3rd person pronouns, reflexive and relative pronouns. The
investigation has shown that a high level of grammatical ambiguity, specific
features  of reflexive pronouns, free word order and special cases of
non-referential pronouns in Russian impact the quality of anaphora resolution
systems. Error analysis reveals some specific features of anaphora resolution
for morphologically rich and free word order languages with a lack of gold
standard resources.
