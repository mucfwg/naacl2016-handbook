Abstract#==#Anaphoric connectives are event anaphors (or abstract anaphors) that in
addition convey a coherence relation holding between the antecedent and the
host clause of the connective. Some of them carry an explicitly-anaphoric
morpheme, others do not. We analysed the set of German connectives for this
property and found that many have an additional non-connective reading, where
they serve as nominal anaphors. Furthermore, many connectives can have multiple
senses, so altogether the processing of these words can involve substantial
disambiguation. We study the problem for one specific German word,
'demzufolge', which can be taken as representative for a large group of similar
words.
