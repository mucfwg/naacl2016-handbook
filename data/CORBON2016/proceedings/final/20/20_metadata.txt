Abstract#==#Resolution of the anaphoric entities in natural language text is very much
essential to extract the complete information from the text. In this paper, we
present a methodology to resolve one of the difficult pronouns, plural pronouns
with split antecedents in Tamil. We have used a salience measure based approach
with salience factors obtained from sub-categorization information of nouns and
selectional restriction rules of the verbs. We have evaluated our approach with
Tamil novel corpus and the results are encouraging.
