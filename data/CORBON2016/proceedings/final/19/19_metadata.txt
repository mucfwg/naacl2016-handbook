Abstract#==#Verb Phrase Ellipsis is a well-studied topic in theoretical linguistics but has
received little attention as a computational problem. Here we propose a
decomposition of the overall resolution problem into three tasks-target
detection, antecedent head resolution, and antecedent boundary detection-and
implement a number of computational approaches for each one. We also explore
the relationships among these tasks by attempting joint learning over different
combinations. Our new decomposition of the problem yields significantly
improved performance on publicly available datasets, including a newly
contributed one.
