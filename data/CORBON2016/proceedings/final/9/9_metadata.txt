Abstract#==#This paper approaches the challenge of adapting coreference resolution to
different coreference phenomena and mention-border definitions when there is no
access to large training data in the desired target scheme. We take a
configurable, rule-based approach centered on dependency syntax input, which we
test by examining coreference types not covered in benchmark corpora such as
OntoNotes. These include cataphora, compound modifier coreference, generic
anaphors, predicate markables, i-within-i, and metonymy. We test our system,
called xrenner, using different configurations on two very different datasets:
Wall Street Journal material from OntoNotes and four types Wiki data from the
GUM corpus. Our system compares favorably with two leading rule based and
stochastic approaches in handling the different annotation formats.
