Abstract#==#In this paper, we present a syntactic approach to the annotation of bridging
relations, so-called genitive bridging. We introduce the RuGenBridge corpus for
Russian annotated with genitive bridging and compare it to the semantic
approach that was applied in the Prague Dependency Treebank for Czech. We
discuss some special aspects of bridging resolution for Russian and specifics
of bridging annotation for languages where definite nominal groups are not as
frequent as e.g. in Romance and Germanic languages. To verify the consistency
of our method, we carry out two comparative experiments: the annotation of a
small portion of our corpus with bridging relations according to both
approaches and finding for all relations from the RuGenBridge their semantic
interpretation that would be annotated for Czech.
