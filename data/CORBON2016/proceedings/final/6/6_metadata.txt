Abstract#==#This paper focuses on the interaction of chains of coreference identity with
other types of relations, comparing English and German data sets in terms of
language, mode (written vs. spoken) and register. We first describe the types
of coreference and the chain features analysed as indicators of textual
coherence and topic continuity. After sketching the feature categories under
analysis and the methods used for statistical evaluation, we present the
findings from our analysis and interpret them in terms of the contrasts
mentioned above. We will also show that for some registers, coreference types
other than identity are of great importance.
