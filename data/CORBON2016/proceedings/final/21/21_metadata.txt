Abstract#==#The paper attempts at presenting initial verification of existing approaches to
annotation of bridging relations by proposing a compiled model based on
schemata used in previous annotation projects and testing its validity on a
corpus of Polish. The categorization features structural relations,
dissimilation, analogy, reference to label, class, entailment and attribution.
Multiple categories can be assigned to model situations where several aspects
of the relation play a part. The relations are organized hierarchically which
allows varied granularity of processing depending on computational needs. The
classification is confronted with existing annotation of other-than-identity
relations in a portion of Polish Coreference Corpus. Results of manual
annotation involving two annotators and adjudicator are presented. Findings
from the process are intended to facilitate development of annotation
guidelines of a new reference-related project.
