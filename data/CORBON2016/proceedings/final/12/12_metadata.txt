Abstract#==#We consider several antecedent prediction models that use no pipelined features
generated by upstream systems. Models trained in this way are interesting
because they allow for side-stepping the intricacies of upstream models, and
because we might expect them to generalize better to situations in which
upstream features are unavailable or unreliable. Through quantitative and
qualitative error analysis we identify what sorts of cases are particularly
difficult for such models, and suggest some directions for further improvement.
