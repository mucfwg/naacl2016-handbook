Abstract#==#This paper focuses on identity-of-sense anaphoric relations, in which the sense
is shared but not the referent. We are not restricted to the pronoun "one", the
focus of
the small body of previous NLP work on this phenomenon, but look at a wider
range of pronouns ("that", "some", "another", etc.). We develop annotation
guidelines, enrich a third of English OntoNotes with sense anaphora
annotations, and shed light onto this phenomenon from a corpus-based
perspective. We release the annotated data as part of the SAnaNotes corpus. We
also use this corpus to develop a learning-based classifier to identify sense
anaphoric uses, showing both the power and limitations of local features.
