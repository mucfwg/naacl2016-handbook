Abstract#==#Recent approaches based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) have shown
promising results for short-text classification. However, many short texts
occur in sequences (e.g., sentences in a document or utterances in a dialog),
and most existing ANN-based systems do not leverage the preceding short texts
when classifying a subsequent one. In this work, we present a model based on
recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks that incorporates
the preceding short texts. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on three
different datasets for dialog act prediction.
