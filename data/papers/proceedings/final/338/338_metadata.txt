Abstract#==#Automatically learning script knowledge has proved difficult, with previous
work not or just barely beating a most-frequent baseline. Script knowledge is a
type of world knowledge which can however be useful for various task in NLP and
psycholinguistic modelling. We here propose a model that includes participant
information (i.e., knowledge about which participants are relevant for a
script) and show, on the Dinners from Hell corpus as well as the InScript
corpus, that this knowledge helps us to significantly improve prediction
performance on the narrative cloze task.
