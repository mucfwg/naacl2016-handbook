Abstract#==#In the absence of annotations in the target language, multilingual models
typically draw on extensive parallel resources. In this paper, we demonstrate
that accurate multilingual part-of-speech (POS) tagging can be done with just a
few (e.g., ten) word translation pairs. We use the translation pairs to
establish a coarse linear isometric (orthonormal) mapping between monolingual
embeddings. This enables the supervised source model expressed in terms of
embeddings to be used directly on the target language. We further refine the
model in an unsupervised manner by initializing and regularizing it to be close
to the direct transfer model. Averaged across six languages, our model yields a
37.5% absolute improvement over the monolingual prototype-driven method
(Haghighi and Klein, 2006) when using a comparable amount of supervision.
Moreover, to highlight key linguistic characteristics of the generated tags, we
use them to predict typological properties of languages, obtaining a 50% error
reduction relative to the prototype model.
