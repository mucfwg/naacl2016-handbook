Abstract#==#Previous work on Automatic Paraphrase Identification (PI) is mainly based on
modeling text similarity between two sentences. 
In contrast,  we study methods for automatically detecting whether a text
fragment only appearing in a sentence of the evaluated sentence pair is
important or ancillary information with respect to the paraphrase
identification task.
Engineering features for this new task is rather difficult, thus, we approach
the problem by representing text with syntactic structures and applying tree
kernels on them. The results show that the accuracy of our automatic Ancillary
Text Classifier (ATC) is promising, i.e., 68.6\%, and its output can be used to
improve the state of the art in PI.
