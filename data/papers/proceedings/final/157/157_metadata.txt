Abstract#==#Community created content (e.g., product descriptions, reviews) typically
discusses one entity at a time and it can be hard as well as time consuming for
a user to compare two or more entities. In response, we define a novel task of
automatically generating entity  comparisons from text. Our output is a table
that semantically clusters descriptive phrases about entities. Our clustering
algorithm is a Gaussian extension of probabilistic latent semantic analysis
(pLSA), in which each phrase is represented in word vector embedding space. In
addition, our algorithm attempts to balance information about entities in each
cluster to generate meaningful comparison tables, where possible. We test our
systemâ€™s effectiveness on two domains, travel articles and movie reviews, and
find that entity-balanced clusters are strongly preferred by users.
