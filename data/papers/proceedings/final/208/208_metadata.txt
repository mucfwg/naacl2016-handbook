Abstract#==#Gold annotations for supervised implicit semantic role labeling are extremely
sparse and costly. As a lightweight alternative, this paper describes an
approach based on unsupervised parsing which can do without iSRL-specific
training data: We induce prototypical roles from large amounts of explicit SRL
annotations paired with their distributed word representations. An evaluation
shows competitive performance with supervised methods on the SemEval 2010 data,
and our method can easily be applied to predicates (or languages) for which no
training annotations are available.
