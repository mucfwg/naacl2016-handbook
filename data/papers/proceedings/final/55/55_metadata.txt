Abstract#==#We tackle the task of extracting tweets that mention a specific event from all
tweets that contain relevant keywords, for which the main challenges include
unbalanced positive and negative cases, and the unavailability of manually
labeled training data. Existing methods leverage a few manually given seed
events and large unlabeled tweets to train a classifier, by using expectation
regularization training with discrete ngram features. We propose a LSTM-based
neural model that learns tweet-level features automatically. Compared with
discrete ngram features, the neural model can potentially capture non-local
dependencies and deep semantic information, which are more effective for
disambiguating subtle semantic differences between true event mentions and
false cases that use similar wording patterns. Results on both tweets and forum
posts show that our neural model is more effective compared with a
state-of-the-art discrete baseline.
