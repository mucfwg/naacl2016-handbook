Abstract#==#We present an approach to learning multi-sense word embeddings relying both on
monolingual and bilingual information. Our model consists of an encoder, which
uses monolingual and bilingual context (i.e. a parallel sentence) to choose a
sense for a given word, and a decoder which predicts context words based on the
chosen sense. The two components are estimated jointly. We observe that the
word representations induced from bilingual data outperform the monolingual
counterparts across a range of evaluation tasks, even though crosslingual
information is not available at test time.
