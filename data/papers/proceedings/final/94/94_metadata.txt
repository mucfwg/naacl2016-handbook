Abstract#==#Persuasive communication is the process of shaping, reinforcing and changing
others' responses. In political debates, speakers express their views towards
the debated topics through not only the choice of discourse content but also an
argumentation process. In this work we study the use of semantic frames for
modelling argumentation in speakers' discourse. We investigate the impact of a
speaker's argumentation style and their effect in influencing an audience in
supporting their candidature. We model the influence index of each candidate
based on results of national polls occurring immediately after a debate took
place and present a system which ranks speakers in terms of their relative
influence based on a combination of content and persuasive argumentation
features. Our results show that although content alone is predictive of a
speaker's influence rank, persuasive argumentation also affects such indices.
