Abstract#==#This paper presents the first study using neural machine translation (NMT) for
grammatical error correction (GEC). We propose a two-step approach to handle
the rare word problem in NMT, which has been proved to be useful and effective
for the GEC task. Our best NMT-based system trained on the CLC outperforms our
SMT-based system when testing on the publicly available FCE test set. The same
system achieves an F-0.5 score of 39.90% on the CoNLL-2014 shared task test
set, outperforming the state-of-the-art and demonstrating that the NMT-based
GEC system generalises effectively.
