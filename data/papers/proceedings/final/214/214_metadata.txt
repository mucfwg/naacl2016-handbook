Abstract#==#A key challenge for timeline summarization is to generate a concise, yet
complete storyline from large collections of news stories. Previous studies in
extractive timeline generation are limited in two aspects: first, most prior
work focuses on fully-observable ranking models or clustering models with
hand-designed features that may not generalize well. Second, most summarization
corpora are text-only, which means that text is the sole source of information
considered in timeline summarization, and thus, the rich visual content from
news images is ignored. To solve these issues, we leverage the success of
matrix factorization techniques from recommender systems, and cast the
generation problem as a sentence recommendation task, using a representation
learning approach. To augment text-only corpora, for each candidate sentence in
a news article, we take advantage of top-ranked relevant images from the Web
and model the image using a convolutional neural network architecture. Finally,
we propose a scalable low-rank approximation approach for learning  joint
embeddings of news stories and images. In experiments, we compare our model to
various competitive baselines, and demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance
of the proposed text-based and multimodal approaches.
