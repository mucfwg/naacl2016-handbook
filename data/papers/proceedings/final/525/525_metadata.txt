Abstract#==#This paper proposes an incremental learning strategy of neural word embedding
methods, which is a simple modification of conventional methods, such as
SkipGrams and Global Vectors.
 Since our method iteratively constructs embedding vectors one dimension by one
dimension, obtained vectors equip a unique property, namely, any
right-truncated vector matches the solutions of the corresponding
lower-dimensional embedding.
 Therefore, a single embedding vector can manage a wide range of dimensional
requirements imposed by many different uses and applications.
 We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by evaluating the obtained
embedding vectors on a wide variety of linguistic benchmark data.
