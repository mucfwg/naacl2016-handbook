Abstract#==#In named entity recognition task especially
for massive data like Twitter, having a large
amount of high quality gazetteers can alleviate
the problem of training data scarcity. One
could collect large gazetteers from knowledge
graph and phrase embeddings to obtain
high coverage of gazetteers. However, large
gazetteers cause a side-effect called “feature
under-training”, where the gazetteer features
overwhelm the context features. To resolve
this problem, we propose the dropout conditional
random fields, which decrease the influence
of gazetteer features with a high weight.
Our experiments on named entity recognition
with Twitter data lead to higher F1 score of
69.38%, about 4% better than the strong baseline
presented in Smith and Osborne (2006).
