Abstract#==#Coreference resolution is one of the first stages in deep language
understanding and its importance has been well recognized in the natural
language processing community. In this paper, we propose a generative,
unsupervised ranking model for entity coreference resolution. Our unsupervised
system achieves 58.44% F1 score of the CoNLL metric on the English data from
CoNLL-2012 shared task, outperforming the Stanford deterministic system, the
winner of the CoNLL 2011 shared task, by 3.01% absolute.
