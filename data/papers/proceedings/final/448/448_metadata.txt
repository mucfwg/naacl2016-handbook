Abstract#==#A corpus of inference rules between a pair of relation phrases is typically
generated using the statistical overlap of argument-pairs associated with the
relations (e.g., PATTY, CLEAN). We investigate knowledge-guided linguistic
rewrites as a secondary source of evidence and find that they can vastly
improve the quality of inference rule corpora, obtaining 27 to 33 point
precision improvement while retaining substantial recall. The facts inferred
using cleaned inference rules are 29-32 points more accurate.
