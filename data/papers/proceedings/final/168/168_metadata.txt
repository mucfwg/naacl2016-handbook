Abstract#==#Historical documents frequently exhibit extensive orthographic variation,
including archaic spellings and obsolete shorthand. OCR tools typically seek to
produce so-called diplomatic transcriptions that preserve these variants, but
many end tasks require transcriptions with normalized orthography.
In this paper, we present a novel joint transcription model that learns,
unsupervised, a probabilistic mapping between modern orthography and that used
in the document. Our system thus produces dual diplomatic and normalized
transcriptions simultaneously, and
achieves a 35% relative error reduction over a state-of-the-art OCR model on
diplomatic transcription, and a 46% reduction on normalized transcription.
