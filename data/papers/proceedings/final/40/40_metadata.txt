Abstract#==#Morphological inflection generation is the task of generating the inflected
form of a given lemma corresponding to a particular linguistic transformation.
We model the problem of inflection generation as a character sequence to
sequence learning problem and present a variant of the neural encoder-decoder
model for solving it. Our model is language independent and can be trained in
both supervised and semi-supervised settings. We evaluate our system on seven
datasets of morphologically rich languages and achieve either better or
comparable results to existing state-of-the-art models of inflection
generation.
