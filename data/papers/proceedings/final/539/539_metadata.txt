Abstract#==#The goal of Event extraction is to extract structured information of events
that are of interest from unstructured documents. Existing event extractors for
social media suffer from two major problems: lack of context and informal
nature. In this paper, instead of conducting event extraction solely on each
social media message, we incorporate cross-genre knowledge to boost the event
extractor performance. Experiment results demonstrate that without any
additional annotations, our proposed approach is able to provide 15% absolute
F-score improvement over the state-of-the-art.
