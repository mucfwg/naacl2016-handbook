Abstract#==#Computational approaches to simultaneous interpretation are held back by how
little we know about the tactics human interpreters use. We produce a parallel
corpus of translated and simultaneously interpreted text and study differences
between them through a computational approach. Our analysis reveals that human
interpreters regularly apply several effective tactics to reduce translation
latency, including sentence segmentation and passivization. In addition to
these unique, clever strategies, we show that limited human memory also causes
other idiosyncratic properties of human interpretation such as generalization
and omission of source content.
