Abstract#==#This paper proposes a variability normalization algorithm to reduce the
variability between intra-topic documents for topic classification. Firstly, an
optimization problem is constructed based on linear variability removable
assumption. Secondly, a new feature space for document representation is found
by solving the optimization problem with kernel principle component analysis
(KPCA). Finally, effective feature transformation is taken through linear
projection. As for experiments, state-of-the-art SVM and KNN algorithm are
adopted for topic classification respectively. Experimental results on a
free-style conversational corpus show that the proposed variability
normalization algorithm for topic classification achieves 3.8% absolute
improvement for micro-F1 measure.
