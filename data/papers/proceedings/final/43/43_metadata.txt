Abstract#==#Children learn the meaning of words by being
exposed to perceptually rich situations (linguistic discourse, 
visual scenes, etc). Current
computational learning models typically simulate 
these rich situations through impoverished symbolic 
approximations. In this work,
we present a distributed word learning model
that operates on child-directed speech paired
with realistic visual scenes. The model integrates 
linguistic and extra-linguistic information 
(visual and social cues), handles referential 
uncertainty, and correctly learns to associate 
words with objects, even in cases of limited linguistic exposure.
