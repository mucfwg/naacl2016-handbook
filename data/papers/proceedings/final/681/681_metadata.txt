Abstract#==#We compare different word embeddings from a standard window based skipgram
model, a skipgram model trained using dependency context features and a novel
skipgram variant that utilizes additional information from dependency graphs.
We explore the effectiveness of the different types of word embeddings for word
similarity and sentence classification tasks. We consider three common sentence
classification tasks: question type classification on the TREC dataset, binary
sentiment classification on Stanford's Sentiment Treebank and semantic relation
classification on the SemEval 2010 dataset. For each task we use three
different classification methods: a Support Vector Machine, a Convolutional
Neural Network and a Long Short Term Memory Network.
Our experiments show that dependency based embeddings outperform standard
window based embeddings in most of the settings, while using dependency context
embeddings as additional features improves performance in all tasks regardless
of the classification method.
