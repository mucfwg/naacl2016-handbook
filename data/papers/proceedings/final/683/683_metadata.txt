Abstract#==#In this paper, we study, compare and combine two state-of-the-art approaches to
automatic feature engineering:              Convolution Tree Kernels (CTKs) and
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for learning to rank answer sentences in a
Question Answering (QA) setting.  
When dealing with QA, the key aspect is to encode relational information
between the constituents of question and answer in learning algorithms. For
this purpose, we propose novel CNNs using relational information and combined
them with relational CTKs.
The results show that (i) both approaches achieve the state of the art on a
question answering task, where CTKs produce higher accuracy and (ii) combining
such methods leads to unprecedented high results.
