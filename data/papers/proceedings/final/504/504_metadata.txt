Abstract#==#The Lexical Substitution task involves selecting and ranking lexical
paraphrases for a target word in a given sentential context. We present PIC, a
simple measure for estimating the appropriateness of substitutes in a given
context. PIC outperforms another simple, comparable model proposed in recent
work, especially when selecting substitutes from the entire vocabulary.
Analysis shows that PIC improves over baselines by incorporating frequency
biases into predictions.
