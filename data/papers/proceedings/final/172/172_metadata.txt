Abstract#==#We build a multi-source machine translation model and train it to maximize the
probability of a target English string given French and German sources.  Using
the neural encoder-decoder framework, we explore several combination methods
and report up to +4.8 Bleu increases on top of a very strong attention-based
neural translation model.
