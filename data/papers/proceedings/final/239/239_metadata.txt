Abstract#==#Recently, researchers have demonstrated that both Chinese word and its
component characters provide rich semantic information when learning Chinese
word embeddings. However, they ignored the semantic similarity across component
characters in a word. In this paper, we learn the semantic contribution of
characters to a word by exploiting the similarity between a word and its
component characters with the semantic knowledge obtained from other languages.
We propose a similarity-based method to learn Chinese word and character
embeddings jointly. This method is also capable of disambiguating Chinese
characters and distinguishing non-compositional Chinese words. Experiments on
word similarity and text classification demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method.
