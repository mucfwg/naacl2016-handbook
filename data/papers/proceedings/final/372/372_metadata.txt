Abstract#==#This paper introduces information density and machine translation quality
estimation inspired features to automatically detect and classify human
translated texts. We investigate two settings: discriminating between
translations and comparable originally authored texts, and distinguishing two
levels of translation professionalism. Our framework is based on delexicalised
sentence-level dense feature vector representations combined with a supervised
machine learning approach. The results show state-of-the-art performance for
mixed-domain translationese detection with information density and quality
estimation based features, while results on translation expertise
classification are mixed.
