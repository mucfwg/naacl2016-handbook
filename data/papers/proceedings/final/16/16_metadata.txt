Abstract#==#We introduce a novel technique called dynamic feature induction that keeps
inducing high dimensional features automatically until the feature space
becomes ‘more’ linearly separable. Dynamic feature induction searches for
the feature combinations that give strong clues for distinguishing certain
label pairs, and generates joint features from these combinations. These
induced features are trained along with the primitive low dimensional features.
Our approach was evaluated on two core NLP tasks, part-of-speech tagging and
named entity recognition, and showed the state-of-the-art results for both
tasks, achieving the accuracy of 97.64 and the F1-score of 91.00 respectively,
with about a 25% increase in the feature space.
