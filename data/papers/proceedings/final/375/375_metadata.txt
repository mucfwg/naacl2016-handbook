Abstract#==#This paper addresses the problem of comment classification in community
Question Answering. Following the state of the art, we approach the task with a
global inference process to exploit the information of all com- ments in the
answer-thread in the form of a fully connected graph. Our contribution
comprises two novel joint learning models that are online and integrate
inference within learning. The first one jointly learns two node- and
edge-level MaxEnt classifiers with stochastic gradient descent and integrates
the inference step with loopy belief propagation. The second model is an
instance of fully connected pairwise CRFs (FCCRF). The FCCRF model
significantly outperforms all other approaches and yields the best results on
the task to date. Crucial elements for its success are the global normalization
and an Ising-like edge potential.
