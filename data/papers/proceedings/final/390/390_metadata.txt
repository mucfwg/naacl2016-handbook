Abstract#==#This paper presents an study of the use of interlocking phrases in phrase-based
statistical machine translation.  We examine the effect on translation quality
when the translation units used in the translation hypotheses are allowed to
overlap on the source side, on the target side and on both sides. A large-scale
evaluation on 380 language pairs was conducted. Our results show that overall
the use of overlapping phrases improved translation quality by 0.3 BLEU points
on average. Further analysis revealed that language pairs requiring a larger
amount of re-ordering benefited the most from our approach. When the evaluation
was restricted to such pairs, the average improvement increased to up to 0.75
BLEU points with over 97\% of the pairs improving. Our approach requires only a
simple modification to the decoding algorithm and we believe it should be
generally applicable to improve the performance of phrase-based decoders.
