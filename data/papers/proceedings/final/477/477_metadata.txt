Abstract#==#We present expected F-measure training for
shift-reduce parsing with RNNs, which enables
the learning of a global parsing model
optimized for sentence-level F1. We apply
the model to CCG parsing, where it improves
over a strong greedy RNN baseline, by 1.47%
F1, yielding state-of-the-art results for shift-reduce
CCG parsing.
