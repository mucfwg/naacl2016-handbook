Abstract#==#As more historical texts are digitized, there is interest in applying natural
language processing tools to these archives. However, the performance of these
tools is often unsatisfactory, due to language change and genre differences.
Spelling normalization heuristics are the dominant solution for dealing with
historical texts, but this approach fails to account for changes in usage and
vocabulary. In this empirical paper, we assess the capability of domain
adaptation techniques to cope with historical texts, focusing on the classic
benchmark task of part-of-speech tagging. We evaluate several domain adaptation
methods on the task of tagging Early Modern English and Modern British English
texts in the Penn Corpora of Historical English. We demonstrate that the
Feature Embedding method for unsupervised domain adaptation outperforms word
embeddings and Brown clusters, showing the importance of embedding the entire
feature space, rather than just individual words. Feature Embeddings also give
better performance than spelling normalization, but the combination of the two
methods is better still, yielding a 5% raw improvement in tagging accuracy on
Early Modern English texts.
