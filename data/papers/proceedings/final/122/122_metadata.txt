Abstract#==#In many languages, sparse availability of resources causes numerous challenges
for textual analysis tasks. Text classification is one of such standard tasks
that is hindered due to limited availability of label information in
low-resource languages. Transferring knowledge (i.e. label information) from
high-resource to low-resource languages might improve text classification as
compared to the other approaches like machine translation. We introduce BRAVE
(Bilingual paRAgraph VEctors), a model to learn bilingual distributed
representations (i.e. embeddings) of words without word alignments either from
sentence-aligned parallel or label-aligned non-parallel document corpora to
support cross-language text classification. Empirical analysis shows that
classification models trained with our bilingual embeddings outperforms other
state-of-the-art systems on three different cross-language text classification
tasks.
