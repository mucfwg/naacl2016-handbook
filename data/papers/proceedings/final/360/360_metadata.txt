Abstract#==#Creole languages do not fit into the traditional tree model of evolutionary
history because multiple languages are involved in their formation.
In this paper, we present several statistical models to explore the nature of
creole genesis.
After reviewing quantitative studies on creole genesis, we first tackle the
question of whether creoles are typologically distinct from non-creoles.
By formalizing this question as a binary classification problem, we demonstrate
that a linear classifier fails to separate creoles from non-creoles although
the two groups have substantially different distributions in the feature space.
We then model a creole language as a mixture of source languages plus a special
restructurer.
We find a pervasive influence of the restructurer in creole genesis and some
statistical universals in it, paving the way for more elaborate statistical
models.
