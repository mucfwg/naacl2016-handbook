Abstract#==#Metaphor is pervasive in our communication, which makes it an important problem
for natural language processing (NLP). Numerous approaches to metaphor
processing have thus been proposed, all of which relied on linguistic features
and textual data to construct their models. Human metaphor comprehension is,
however, known to rely on both our linguistic and perceptual experience, and
vision can play a particularly important role when metaphorically projecting
imagery across domains. In this paper, we present the first metaphor
identification method that simultaneously draws knowledge from linguistic and
visual data. Our results demonstrate that it outperforms linguistic and visual
models in isolation, as well as being competitive with the best-performing
metaphor identification methods, that rely on hand-crafted knowledge about
domains and perception.
