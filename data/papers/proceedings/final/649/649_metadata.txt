Abstract#==#Search tasks, comprising a series of search queries serving a common
informational need, have steadily emerged as accurate units for developing the
next generation of task-aware web search systems. Most prior research in this
area has focused on segmenting chronologically ordered search queries into
higher level tasks. A more naturalistic viewpoint would involve treating query
logs as convoluted structures of tasks-subtasks, with complex search tasks
being decomposed into more focused sub-tasks. In this work, we focus on
extracting sub-tasks from a given collection of on-task search queries. We
jointly leverage insights from Bayesian nonparametrics and word embeddings to
identify and extract sub-tasks from a given collection of \textit{on-task}
queries. Our proposed model can inform the design of the next generation of
task-based search systems that leverage user's task behavior for better support
and personalization.
