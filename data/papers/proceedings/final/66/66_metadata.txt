Abstract#==#We tackle the problem of identifying deceptive agents in highly-motivated
high-conflict dialogues. We consider the case where we only have textual
information. We show the usefulness of psycho-linguistic deception and
persuasion features on a small dataset for the game of Werewolf. We analyse the
role of syntax and we identify some characteristics of players in deceptive
roles.
