Abstract#==#We propose a framework for devising empirically testable algorithms for
bridging the communication gap between humans and robots. We instantiate our
framework in the context of a problem setting in which humans give instructions
to robots using unrestricted natural language commands, with instruction
sequences being subservient to building complex goal configurations in a blocks
world. We show how one can collect meaningful training data and we propose
three neural architectures for interpreting contextually grounded natural
language commands. The proposed architectures allow us to correctly
understand/ground the blocks that the robot should move when instructed by a
human who uses unrestricted language. The architectures have more difficulty in
correctly understanding/grounding the spatial relations required to place
blocks correctly, especially when the blocks are not easily identifiable.
