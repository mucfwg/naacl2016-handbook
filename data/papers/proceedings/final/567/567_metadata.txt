Abstract#==#Can crowdsourced annotation of training data boost performance for relation
extraction over methods based solely on distant supervision?  While
crowdsourcing has been shown effective for many NLP tasks, previous researchers
found only minimal improvement when applying the method to relation extraction.
 This paper demonstrates that a much larger boost is possible, e.g., raising F1
from 0.40 to 0.60. Furthermore, the gains are due to a simple, generalizable
technique, Gated Instruction, which combines an interactive tutorial, feedback
to correct errors during training, and improved screening.
