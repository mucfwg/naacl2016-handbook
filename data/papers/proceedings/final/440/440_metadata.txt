Abstract#==#In this paper, we address the task of language-independent, knowledge-lean and
unsupervised compound splitting, which is an essential component for many
natural language processing tasks such as machine translation. Previous methods
on statistical compound splitting either include language-specific knowledge
(e.g., linking elements) or rely on parallel data, which results in limited
applicability. We aim to overcome these limitations by learning compounding
morphology from inflectional information derived from lemmatized monolingual
corpora. In experiments for Germanic languages, we show that our approach
significantly outperforms language-dependent state-of-the-art methods in
finding the correct split point and that word inflection is a good
approximation for compounding morphology.
