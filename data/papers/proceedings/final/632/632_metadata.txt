Abstract#==#A simile is a figure of speech comparing two
fundamentally different things. Sometimes, a
simile will explain the basis of a comparison
by explicitly mentioning a shared property.
For example, “my room is as cold as Antarctica”
gives “cold” as the property shared by
the room and Antarctica. But most similes do
not give an explicit property (e.g., “my room
feels like Antarctica”) leaving the reader to infer
that the room is cold. We tackle the problem
of automatically inferring implicit properties
evoked by similes. Our approach involves
three steps: (1) generating candidate
properties from different sources, (2) evaluating
properties based on the influence of multiple
simile components, and (3) aggregated
ranking of the properties. We also present an
analysis showing that the difficulty of inferring
an implicit property for a simile correlates
with its interpretive diversity.
