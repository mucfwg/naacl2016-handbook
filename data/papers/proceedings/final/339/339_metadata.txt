Abstract#==#Recently there has been a lot of interest in learning common representations
for multiple views of data. Typically, such common representations are learned
using a parallel corpus between the two views (say, 1M images and their English
captions). In this work, we address a real-world scenario where no direct
parallel data is available between two views of interest (say, V1 and V2) but
parallel data is available between each of these views and a pivot view (V3).
We propose a model for learning a common representation for  V1, V2 and V3
using only the parallel data available between V1V3 and V2V3. The proposed
model is generic and even works when there are n views of interest and only one
pivot view which acts as a bridge between them. There are two specific
downstream applications that we focus on (i) transfer learning between
languages L1,L2,...,Ln using a pivot language L and (ii) cross modal access
between images and a language L1 using a pivot language L2. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance in multilingual document classification on
the publicly available multilingual TED corpus and promising results in
multilingual multimodal retrieval on a new dataset created and
released as a part of this work.
