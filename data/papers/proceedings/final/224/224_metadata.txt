Abstract#==#This paper presents a novel approach using recurrent neural networks for
estimating the quality of machine translation output. A sequence of vectors
made by the prediction method is used as the input of these recurrent neural
networks. The prediction method uses bi-directional recurrent neural networks
architecture both on source and target sentence to fully utilize the
bi-directional quality information from source and target sentence. Our
experiments show that the proposed recurrent neural networks approach achieves
a performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art models for estimating
the sentence-level quality of English-to-Spanish translation.
