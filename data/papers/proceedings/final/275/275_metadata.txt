Abstract#==#We present a model of morphological segmentation that jointly learns to segment
and restore orthographic changes, e.g., funniest → fun-y-est. We term this
form of analysis canonical segmentation and contrast it with the traditional
surface segmentation, which segments a surface form into a sequence of
substrings, e.g., funniest → funn-i-est. We derive an importance sampling
algorithm for approximate inference in the model and report experimental
results on English, German and Indonesian.
