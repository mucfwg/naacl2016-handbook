Abstract#==#Recent work across several AI subdisciplines has focused on automatically
solving math word problems.  In this paper we introduce MAWPS, an online
repository of Math Word Problems, to provide a unified testbed to evaluate
different algorithms. MAWPS allows for the automatic construction of datasets
with particular characteristics, providing tools for tuning the lexical and
template overlap of a dataset as well as for filtering ungrammatical problems
from web-sourced corpora. The online nature of this repository facilitates easy
community contribution. At present, we have amassed 3,320 problems, including
the full datasets used in several prominent works.
