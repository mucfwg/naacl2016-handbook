Abstract#==#In this paper we present new state-of-the-art performance on CCG supertagging
and parsing.  Our model outperforms existing approaches by an absolute gain of
1.5%.  We analyze the performance of several neural models and demonstrate that
while feed-forward  architectures can compete with bidirectional LSTMs on POS
tagging, models that encode the complete sentence are necessary for the long
range syntactic information encoded in supertags.
