Abstract#==#We address relation classification in the context of slot filling, the task of
finding and evaluating fillers like "Steve Jobs" for the slot X in "X founded
Apple". We propose a convolutional neural network which splits the input
sentence into three parts according to the relation arguments and compare it to
state-of-the-art and traditional approaches of relation classification.
Finally, we combine different methods and show that the combination is better
than individual approaches. We also analyze the effect of genre differences on
performance.
