Abstract#==#Active learning is a framework that makes it possible to efficiently train
statistical models by selecting informative examples from a pool of unlabeled
data.
Previous work has found this framework effective for machine translation (MT),
making it possible to train better translation models with less effort,
particularly when annotators translate short phrases instead of full sentences.
However, previous methods for phrase-based active learning in MT fail to
consider whether the selected units are coherent and easy for human translators
to translate, and also have problems with selecting redundant phrases with
similar content.
In this paper, we tackle this problem by proposing two new methods for
selecting more syntactically coherent and less redundant segments in active
learning for MT.
Experiments using both simulation and extensive manual translation by
professional translators find the proposed method effective, achieving both
greater gain of BLEU score for the same number of translated words, and
allowing
translators to be more confident in their translations.
