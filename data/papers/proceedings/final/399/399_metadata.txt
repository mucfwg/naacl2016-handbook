Abstract#==#Paronomasic puns create humor through the relationship between a pun and its
phonologically similar target. For example, in "Don't take geologists for
granite" the word "granite" is a pun with the target "granted". The recovery of
the target in the mind of the listener is essential to the success of the pun.
This work introduces a new model for automatic target recovery and provides the
first empirical test for this task. The model draws upon techniques for
automatic speech recognition using weighted finite-state transducers, and
leverages automatically learned phone edit probabilities that give insight into
how people perceive sounds and into what makes a good pun.  The model is
evaluated on a small corpus where it is able to automatically recover a large
fraction of the pun targets.
