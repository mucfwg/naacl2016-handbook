Abstract#==#While there is increasing interest in automatically recognizing the
argumentative structure of a text, recognizing the argumentative purpose of
revisions to such texts has been less explored. Furthermore, existing revision
classification approaches typically ignore  contextual information. We propose
two approaches for utilizing contextual information when predicting
argumentative revision purposes: 
developing contextual features for use in the classification paradigm of prior
work, and transforming the classification problem to a sequence labeling task.
Experimental results using two corpora of  student essays demonstrate the
utility of contextual information for predicting argumentative revision
purposes.
