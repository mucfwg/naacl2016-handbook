Abstract#==#Textual similarity measurement is a challenging problem, as it requires
understanding the semantics of input sentences. Most previous neural network
models use coarse-grained sentence modeling, which has difficulty capturing
fine-grained word-level information for semantic comparisons. As an
alternative, we propose to explicitly model pairwise word interactions and
present a novel similarity focus mechanism to identify important
correspondences for better similarity measurement. Our ideas are implemented in
a novel neural network architecture that demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy
on three SemEval tasks and two answer selection tasks.
