Abstract#==#We propose a novel neural network model for machine reading, DER Network, which
explicitly
implements a reader building dynamic meaning representations for entities by
gathering and accumulating information around the entities as it reads a
document. Evaluated on a recent large scale dataset (Hermann et al., 2015), our
model exhibits better results than previous research, and we find that
max-pooling is suited for modeling the accumulation of information on entities.
Further analysis suggests that our model can put together multiple pieces of
information encoded in different sentences to answer complicated questions.
