Abstract#==#This paper presents a methodology to extract positive interpretations from
negated statements. First, we automatically generate plausible interpretations
using well-known grammar rules and manipulating semantic roles. Second, we
score plausible alternatives according to their likelihood. Manual annotations
show that the positive interpretations are intuitive to humans, and
experimental results show that the scoring task can be automated.
