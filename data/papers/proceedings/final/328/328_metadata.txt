Abstract#==#Argumentation mining is considered as a key technology for future search
engines and automated decision making. In such applications, argumentative text
segments have to be mined from large and diverse document collections. However,
most existing argumentation mining approaches tackle the classification of
argumentativeness only for a few manually annotated documents from narrow
domains and registers. This limits their practical applicability. We hence
propose a distant supervision approach that acquires argumentative text
segments automatically from online debate portals. Experiments across domains
and registers show that training on such a corpus improves the effectiveness
and robustness of mining argumentative text. We freely provide the underlying
corpus for research.
