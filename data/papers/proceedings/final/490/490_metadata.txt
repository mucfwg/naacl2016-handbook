Abstract#==#Understanding how a fictional relationship between two characters changes over
time (e.g., from best friends to sworn enemies) is a key challenge in digital
humanities scholarship. We present a novel unsupervised neural network for this
task that incorporates dictionary learning to generate interpretable, accurate
relationship trajectories. While previous work on characterizing literary
relationships relies on plot summaries annotated with predefined labels, our
model jointly learns a set of global relationship descriptors as well as a
trajectory over these descriptors for each relationship in a dataset of raw
text from novels. We find that our model learns descriptors of events (e.g.,
marriage or murder) as well as interpersonal states (love, sadness). Our model
outperforms topic model baselines on two crowdsourced tasks, and we also find
interesting correlations to annotations in an existing dataset.
