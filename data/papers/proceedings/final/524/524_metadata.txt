Abstract#==#Quotations are kernels not just of wisdom but also of beautiful and striking
language. While recent studies have characterized the stylistic features of
quotations, we characterize the order of stylistic information within
quotations. Analyzing a corpus of two-sentence quotations collected from the
social network Tumblr, we explore the ways that both low-level features and
high-level features tend to occur in either the first or second sentence.
Through analysis of examples, we interpret these tendencies as manifestations
of rhetorical patterns. Results from a prediction task suggest that stylistic
patterns are more prominent in quotations than in a comparison corpus.
