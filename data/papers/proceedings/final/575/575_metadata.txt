Abstract#==#Obtaining common sense knowledge using current information extraction
techniques is extremely challenging.In this work, we instead propose to derive
simple common sense statements from fully annotated object detection corpora
such as the Microsoft Common Objects in Context dataset. We show that many
thousands of common sense facts can be extracted from such corpora at high
quality. Furthermore, using WordNet and a novel sub-modular k-coverage
formulation, we are able to generalize our initial set of common sense
assertions to unseen objects and uncover over 400k potentially useful facts.
