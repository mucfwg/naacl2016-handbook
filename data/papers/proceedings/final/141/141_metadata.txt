Abstract#==#We present a simple yet powerful approach to non-factoid answer reranking
whereby question-answer pairs are represented by concatenated distributed
representation vectors and a multilayer perceptron is used to compute the score
for an answer. Despite its simplicity, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on a public dataset of How questions, outperforming systems which
employ sophisticated feature sets. We attribute this good performance to the
use of paragraph instead of word vector representations and to the use of
suitable data for training these representations.
