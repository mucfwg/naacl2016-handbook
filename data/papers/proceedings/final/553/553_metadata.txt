Abstract#==#This paper presents a data-driven investigation of "phonesthemes", phonetic
units said to carry meaning associations, thus challenging the traditionally
assumed arbitrariness of language. Phonesthemes have received a substantial
amount of attention within the cognitive science literature on sound iconicity,
but nevertheless remain a controversial and understudied phenomenon. Here we
employ NLP techniques  to address two main questions: How can the existence of
phonesthemes be tested at a large scale with quantitative methods? And how can
the meaning arguably carried by a phonestheme be induced automatically from
word embeddings? We develop novel methods to make progress on these fronts and
compare our results to previous work, obtaining substantial improvements.
