Abstract#==#Sequence labeling for extraction of medical events and their attributes from
unstructured text in Electronic Health Record (EHR) notes is a key step towards
semantic understanding of EHRs. It has important applications in health
informatics including pharmacovigilance and drug surveillance. The state of the
art supervised machine learning models in this domain are based on Conditional
Random Fields (CRFs) with features calculated from fixed context windows.
However, different types of medical events have dependencies in different
context window sizes. In this application, we explored recurrent neural network
frameworks and show that they significantly outperformed the CRF models. We
analyze the performance of the RNN models and show that they can more
efficiently discriminate between medical entities, using the same context size
as the CRF models.
