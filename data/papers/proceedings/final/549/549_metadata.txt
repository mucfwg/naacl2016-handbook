Abstract#==#Word clusters are useful for many NLP tasks including training neural network
language models, but current increases in datasets are outpacing the ability of
word clusterers to handle them.  Little attention has been paid thus far on
inducing high-quality word clusters at a large scale.  The predictive exchange
algorithm is quite scalable, but sometimes does not provide as good perplexity
as other slower clustering algorithms.

We introduce the bidirectional, interpolated, refining, and alternating (BIRA)
predictive exchange algorithm.              It improves upon the predictive exchange
algorithm's perplexity by up to 18%, giving it perplexities comparable to the
slower two-sided exchange algorithm, and better perplexities than the slower
Brown clustering algorithm.  Our BIRA implementation is fast, clustering a 2.5
billion token English News Crawl corpus in 3 hours.  It also reduces machine
translation training time while preserving translation quality.  Our
implementation is portable and freely available.
