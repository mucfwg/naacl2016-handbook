Abstract#==#We propose a first-ever attempt to employ a Long Short-Term memory based
framework to predict humor in dialogues. We analyze data from a popular
TV-sitcom, whose canned laughters give an indication of when the audience would
react. We model the setup-punchline relation of conversational humor with a
Long Short-Term Memory, with utterance encodings obtained from a Convolutional
Neural Network. Out neural network framework is able to improve the F-score of
8% over a Conditional Random Field baseline. We show how the LSTM effectively
models the setup-punchline relation reducing the number of false positives and
increasing the recall. We aim to employ our humor prediction model to build
effective empathetic machine able to understand jokes.
