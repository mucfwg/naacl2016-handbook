Abstract#==#Traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) based query classification uses
linear feature mapping in its convolution operation. The recurrent neural
network (RNN), differs from a CNN in representing word sequence with their
ordering information kept explicitly. We propose using a deep
long-short-term-memory (DLSTM) based feature mapping to learn feature
representation for CNN. The DLSTM, which is a stack of LSTM units, has
different order of feature representations at different depth of LSTM unit. The
bottom LSTM unit equipped with input and output gates, extracts the first order
feature representation from current word position. To extract higher order
nonlinear feature representation, the LSTM unit at higher position gets input
from two parts. First part is the lower LSTM unit’s memory cell from previous
word. Second part is the lower LSTM unit’s hidden output from current word.
In this way, taking advantage of different types of gates in LSTM unit, the
DLSTM captures the nonlinear nonconsecutive interaction within n-grams. Using
an architecture that combines a stack of the DLSTM layers with a tradition CNN
layer, we have observed new state-of-the-art query classification accuracy on
benchmark data sets for query classification.
