Abstract#==#An increasing amount of research has recently focused on representing affective
states as continuous numerical values on multiple dimensions, such as the
valence-arousal (VA) space. Compared to the categorical approach that
represents affective states as several classes (e.g., positive and negative),
the dimensional approach can provide more fine-grained sentiment analysis.
However, affective resources with valence-arousal ratings are still very rare,
especially for the Chinese language. Therefore, this study builds 1) an
affective lexicon called Chinese valence-arousal words (CVAW) containing 1,653
words, and 2) an affective corpus called Chinese valence-arousal text (CVAT)
containing 2,009 sentences extracted from web texts. To improve the annotation
quality, a corpus cleanup procedure is used to remove outlier ratings and
improper texts. Experiments using CVAW words to predict the VA ratings of the
CVAT corpus show results comparable to those obtained using English affective
resources.
