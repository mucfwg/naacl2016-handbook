Abstract#==#We describe a question answering model that applies to both natural images and
structured knowledge bases. The model uses natural language strings to
automatically assemble deep networks from a collection of composable neural
modules. Parameters for these modules are learned jointly with network-assembly
parameters via reinforcement learning, with only (world, question, answer)
triples as supervision. Our  approach, which we term a _dynamic neural module
network_,  achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets in both
visual and structured domains.
