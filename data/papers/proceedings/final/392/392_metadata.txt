Abstract#==#We propose a hierarchical attention network for document classification. Our
model has two distinctive characteristics: (i) it has a hierarchical structure
that mirrors the hierarchical structure of documents; (ii) it has two levels of
attention mechanisms applied at the word- and sentence-level, enabling it to
attend differentially to more and less important content when constructing the
document representation. Experiments conducted on six large scale text
classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed architecture outperform
previous methods by a substantial margin. Visualization of the attention layers
illustrates that the model selects qualitatively informative words and
sentences.
