Abstract#==#Cross-lingual Wikification is the task of grounding mentions written in
non-English documents to entries in the English Wikipedia. This task involves
the problem of comparing textual clues across languages, which requires
developing a notion of similarity between text snippets across languages. In
this paper, we address this problem by jointly training multilingual embeddings
for words and Wikipedia titles. The proposed method can be applied to all
languages represented in Wikipedia, including those for which no machine
translation technology is available. We create a challenging dataset in 12
languages and show that our proposed approach outperforms various baselines.
Moreover, our model compares favorably with the best systems on the TAC KBP2015
Entity Linking task including those that relied on the availability of
translation from the target language to English.
