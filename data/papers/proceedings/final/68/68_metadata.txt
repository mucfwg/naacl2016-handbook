Abstract#==#In this paper we tackle a challenging name tagging problem in an emergent
setting - the tagger needs to be complete within a few hours for a new incident
language (IL) using very few resources. Inspired by observing how human
annotators attack this challenge, we propose a new expectation-driven learning
framework. In this framework we rapidly acquire, categorize, structure and zoom
in on IL-specific expectations (rules, features, patterns, gazetteers, etc.)
from various non-traditional sources: consulting and encoding linguistic
knowledge from native speakers, mining and projecting patterns from both
mono-lingual and cross-lingual corpora, and typing based on cross-lingual
entity linking. We also propose a cost-aware combination approach to compose
expectations. Experiments on seven low-resource languages demonstrate the
effectiveness and generality of this framework: we are able to setup a name
tagger for a new IL within two hours, and achieve 33.8%-65.1% F-score.
