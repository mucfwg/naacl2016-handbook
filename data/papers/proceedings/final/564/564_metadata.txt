Abstract#==#Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) captures semantic roles (or participants) such as
\texttt{agent}, \texttt{patient}, and \texttt{theme} associated with verbs from
the text. While it provides important intermediate semantic representations for
many traditional NLP tasks (such as information extraction and question
answering), it does not capture grounded semantics so that an artificial agent
can reason, learn, and perform the actions with respect to the physical
environment. To address this problem, this paper extends traditional SRL to
grounded SRL where arguments of verbs are grounded to participants of actions
in the physical world. By integrating language and vision processing through
joint inference, our approach not only grounds explicit roles, but also grounds
implicit roles that are not explicitly mentioned in language descriptions.
This paper describes our empirical results and discusses challenges and future
directions.
