Abstract#==#Given the limited success of medication in reversing the effects of Alzheimer's
and other dementias, a lot of the neuroscience research has been focused on
early detection, in order to slow the progress of the disease through different
interventions. We propose a Natural Language Processing approach applied to
descriptive writing to attempt to discriminate decline due to normal aging from
decline due to predementia conditions. Within the context of a longitudinal
study on Alzheimer's disease, we created a unique corpus of 201 descriptions of
a control image written by subjects of the study. Our classifier, computing
linguistic features, was able to discriminate normal from cognitively impaired
patients to an accuracy of 86.1% using lexical and semantic irregularities
found in their writing. This is a promising result towards elucidating the
existence of a general pattern in linguistic deterioration caused by dementia
that might be detectable from a subject's written descriptive language.
