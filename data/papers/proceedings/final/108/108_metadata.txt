Abstract#==#We present a neural network based shift-reduce CCG parser, the first
neural-network based parser for CCG. We also study the impact of neural network
based tagging models, and greedy versus beam-search parsing, by using a
structured neural network model. Our greedy parser obtains a labeled F-score of
83.27%, the best reported result for greedy CCG parsing in the literature (an 
improvement of 2.5% over a perceptron based greedy parser) and is more than
three times faster. With a beam, our structured neural network model gives a
labeled F-score of 85.57% which is 0.6% better than the perceptron based
counterpart.
