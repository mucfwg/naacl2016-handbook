Abstract#==#Accurate automatic processing of Web queries is important for high-quality
information retrieval from the Web. While the syntactic structure of a large
portion of these queries is trivial, the structure of queries with question
intent is much richer. In this paper we therefore address the task of
statistical syntactic parsing of such queries. We first show that the standard
dependency grammar does not account for the full range of syntactic structures
manifested by queries with question intent. To alleviate this issue we extend
the dependency grammar to account for segments - independent syntactic units
within a potentially larger syntactic structure.

We then propose two distant supervision approaches for the task. Both
algorithms do not require manually parsed queries for training. Instead, they
are trained on millions of (query, page title) pairs from the Community
Question Answering (CQA) domain, where the CQA page was clicked by the user who
initiated the query in a search engine. Experiments on a new treebank
consisting of 5,000 Web queries from the CQA domain, manually parsed using the
proposed grammar, show that our algorithms outperform alternative approaches
trained on various sources: tens of thousands of manually parsed OntoNotes
sentences, millions of unlabeled CQA queries and thousands of manually
segmented CQA queries.
