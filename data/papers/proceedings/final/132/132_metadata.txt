Abstract#==#Knowledge bases of real-world facts about entities and their relationships are
useful resources for a variety of natural language processing tasks. However,
because knowledge bases are typically incomplete, it is useful to be able to
perform link prediction, i.e., predict whether a relationship not in the
knowledge base is likely to be true. This paper combines insights from several
previous link prediction models into a new embedding model STransE that
represents each entity as a low-dimensional vector, and each relation by two
matrices and a translation vector. STransE is a simple combination of the SE
and TransE models, but it obtains better link prediction performance on two
benchmark datasets than previous embedding models. Thus, STransE can serve as a
new baseline for the more complex models in the link prediction task.
