Abstract#==#For many low-resource languages, spoken language resources are more likely to
be annotated with translations than with transcriptions. This bilingual speech
data can be used for word-spotting, spoken document retrieval, and even for
documentation of endangered languages. We experiment with extensions of the
neural, attentional model of Bahdanau et al. for such data. On phone-to-word
alignment and translation reranking tasks, we achieve large improvements
relative to several baselines. On the more challenging speech-to-word alignment
task, our model nearly matches GIZA++'s performance on gold transcriptions, but
without any recourse to transcriptions or to a lexicon.
