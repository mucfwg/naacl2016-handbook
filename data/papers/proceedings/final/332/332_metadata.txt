Abstract#==#This paper investigates two different neural architectures for the task of
relation classification: convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural
networks. For both models, we demonstrate the effect of different architectural
choices. We present a new context representation for convolutional neural
networks for relation classification (extended middle context). Furthermore, we
propose connectionist bi-directional recurrent neural networks and introduce
ranking loss for their optimization. Finally, we show that combining
convolutional and recurrent neural networks using a simple voting scheme is
accurate enough to improve results. Our neural models achieve state-of-the-art
results on the SemEval 2010 relation classification task.
