Abstract#==#Automatically generated databases of English paraphrases have the drawback that
they return a single list of paraphrases for an input word or phrase. This
means that all senses of polysemous words are grouped together, unlike WordNet
which partitions different senses into separate synsets. We present a new
method for clustering paraphrases by word sense, and apply it to the Paraphrase
Database (PPDB). We investigate the performance of hierarchical and spectral
clustering algorithms, and systematically explore different ways of defining
the similarity matrix that they use as input. Our method produces sense
clusters that are qualitatively and quantitatively good, and that represent a
substantial improvement to the PPDB resource.
