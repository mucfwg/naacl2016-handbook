Abstract#==#In a multi-label text classification task, in which multiple labels can be
assigned to one text, label co-occurrence itself is informative.
We propose a novel neural network initialization method to treat some of the
neurons in the final hidden layer as dedicated neurons for each pattern of
label
co-occurrence.
These dedicated neurons are initialized to connect to the corresponding
co-occurring labels with stronger weights than to others.
In experiments with a natural language query classification task, which
requires multi-label classification, our initialization method improved
classification accuracy without any computational overhead in training and
evaluation.
