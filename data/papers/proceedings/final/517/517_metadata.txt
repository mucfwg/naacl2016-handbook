Abstract#==#Jauhar et al. (2015) recently proposed to learn sense-specific word
representations by “retrofitting” standard distributional word
representations to an existing ontology. We observe that this approach does not
require an ontology, and can be generalized to any graph defining word senses
and relations between them. We create such a graph using translations learned
from parallel corpora. On a set of lexical semantic tasks, representations
learned using parallel text perform roughly as well as those derived from
WordNet, and combining the two representation types significantly improves
performance.
