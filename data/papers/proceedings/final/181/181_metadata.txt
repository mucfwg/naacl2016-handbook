Abstract#==#In recent years there have been many knowledge bases (KBs) constructed yet
there is not yet a verb resource that maps to these growing KB resources. A
resource that contains verbs in different languages to identify KB relations
will be useful for extracting more facts to the KBs from any language text and
to aid alignment and integration of knowledge across different KBs and
languages. Such multi-lingual verb resource can also be useful for tasks such
as machine reading and machine translation. In this paper, we present a
scalable approach to automatically construct such verb resource using a very
large web text corpus as a kind of interlingua to relate verb phrases to KB
relations. Given a text corpus in any language and any KB, it can produce a
mapping of that language's verb phrases to the KB relations. Experiments with
English NELL KB and ClueWeb corpus show that the learned English
verb-to-relation mapping is effective for extracting relation instances from
English text. Using the same method on a Portuguese NELL KB and a Portuguese
text corpus, we are able to construct automatically a verb resource in
Portuguese that is effective for extracting relation instances from Portuguese
text.
