Abstract#==#Automatic event schema induction (AESI) means to extract meta-event from raw
text, in other words, to find out what types (templates) of event may exist in
the raw text and what roles (slots) may exist in each event type. In this
paper, we propose a joint entity-driven model to learn templates and slots
simultaneously based on the constraints of templates and slots in the same
sentence. In addition, the entities' semantic information is also considered
for the inner connectivity of the entities. We borrow the normalized cut
criteria in image segmentation to divide the entities into more accurate
template clusters and slot clusters.  The experiment shows that our model gains
a relatively higher result than  previous work.
