Abstract#==#We present Emergent, a novel data-set derived from a digital journalism project
for rumour debunking. The data-set contains 300 rumoured claims and 2,595
associated news articles, collected and labelled by journalists with an
estimation of their veracity true, false or unverified. Each associated article
is summarized into a headline and labelled to indicate whether its stance is
for, against, or observing the claim, where observing indicates that the
article merely repeats the claim. Thus, Emergent provides a  real-world data
source for a variety of natural language processing tasks in the context of
fact-checking. Further to presenting the dataset, we address the task of
determining the article headline stance with respect to the claim. For this
purpose we use a logistic regression classifier and develope features that
examine the headline and its agreement with the claim. The accuracy achieved
was 73% which is 26% higher than the one achieved by the Excitement Open
Platform (Magnini et al., 2014).
