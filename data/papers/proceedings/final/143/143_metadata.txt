Abstract#==#We examine different features and classifiers for the categorization of opinion
words into actor and speaker view. To our knowledge, this is the first
comprehensive work to address sentiment views on the word level taking into
consideration opinion verbs, nouns and adjectives. We consider many high-level
features requiring only few labeled training data. A detailed feature analysis
produces linguistic insights into the nature of sentiment views. We also
examine in how far global constraints between different opinion words help to
increase classification performance.
Finally, we show that our (prior) word-level annotation correlates with
contextual sentiment views.
