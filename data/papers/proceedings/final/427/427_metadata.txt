Abstract#==#This work addresses the task of dependency labelingâ€”assigning labels to an
(unlabeled) dependency tree. We employ and extend a feature representation
learning approach, optimizing it for both high speed and accuracy. We apply our
labeling model on top of state-of-the-art parsers and evaluate its performance
on standard benchmarks including the CoNLL-2009 and the English PTB datasets.
Our model processes over 1,700 English sentences per second, which is 30 times
faster than the sparse-feature method. It improves labeling accuracy over the
outputs of top parsers, achieving the best LAS on 5 out of 7 datasets.
