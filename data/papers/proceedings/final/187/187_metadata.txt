Abstract#==#A major benefit of tree-to-tree over tree-to-string translation is that we can
use target-side syntax to improve reordering. While this is relatively simple
for binarized constituency parses, the reordering problem is considerably
harder for dependency parses, in which parent nodes can have arbitrarily many
children. Previous approaches have tackled this problem by restricting
grammar rules, reducing the expressive power of the translation model.

In this paper we propose a general model for dependency tree-to-tree reordering
based on flexible non-terminals that can compactly encode multiple insertion
positions. We explore how insertion positions can be selected even in cases
where rules do not entirely cover the children of input sentence words. The
proposed method greatly improves the flexibility of translation rules at the
cost of only a 30% increase in decoding time, and we demonstrate a 1.2-1.9 BLEU
improvement over a strong tree-to-tree baseline.
