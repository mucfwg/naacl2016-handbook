Abstract#==#Representation and learning of commonsense knowledge is one of the foundational
problems in the quest to enable deep language understanding. This issue is
particularly challenging for understanding casual and correlational
relationships between events. While this topic has received a lot of interest
in the NLP community, research has been hindered by the lack of a proper
evaluation framework. This paper attempts to address this problem with a new
framework for evaluating story understanding and script learning: the 'Story
Cloze Test'. This test requires a system to choose the correct ending to a
four-sentence story. We created a new corpus of ~50k five-sentence commonsense
stories, ROC-Short-Stories, to enable this evaluation. This corpus is unique in
two ways: (1) it captures a rich set of causal and temporal commonsense
relations between daily events, and (2) it is a high quality collection of
everyday life stories that can also be used for story generation. Experimental
evaluation shows that a host of baselines and state-of-the-art models based on
shallow language understanding struggle to achieve a high score on the Story
Cloze Test. We discuss these implications for script and story learning, and
offer suggestions for deeper language understanding.
