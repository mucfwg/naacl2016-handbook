Abstract#==#Given a pair of sentences, we present computational models to assess if one
sentence is simpler to read than the other. While existing models explored the
usage of phrase structure features using a non-incremental parser, experimental
evidence suggests that the human language processor works incrementally. We
empirically evaluate if syntactic features from an incremental CCG parser are
more useful than features from a non-incremental phrase structure parser. Our
evaluation on Simple and Standard Wikipedia sentence pairs suggests that
incremental CCG features are indeed more useful than phrase structure features
achieving 0.44 points gain in performance. Incremental CCG parser also gives
significant improvements in speed (12 times faster) in comparison to the phrase
structure parser. Furthermore, with the addition of psycholinguistic features,
we achieve the strongest result to date reported on this task. Our code and
data can be downloaded from https://github.com/bharatambati/sent-compl.
