Abstract#==#Student course feedback is generated daily in both classrooms and online course
discussion forums.
Traditionally, instructors manually analyze these responses in a costly manner.
In this work, we propose a new approach to summarizing student course feedback
based on the integer linear programming (ILP) framework.
Our approach allows different student responses to share co-occurrence
statistics and alleviates sparsity issue.
Experimental results on a real-world student feedback corpus show that our
approach 
outperforms a range of baselines in terms of both ROUGE scores and human
evaluation.
