Abstract#==#This study aims to measure the variation between writers in their choices of
referential form by collecting and analysing a new and publicly available
corpus of referring expressions. The corpus is composed of referring
expressions produced by different participants in identical situations.
Results, measured in terms of normalized entropy, reveal substantial individual
variation. We discuss the problems and prospects of this finding for automatic
text generation applications.
