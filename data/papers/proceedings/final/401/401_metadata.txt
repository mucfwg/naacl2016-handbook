Abstract#==#Identification of short text similarity (STS) is a high-utility NLP task with
applications in a variety of domains. We explore adaptation of STS algorithms
to different target domains and applications. A two-level hierarchical Bayesian
model is employed for domain adaptation (DA) of a linear STS model to text from
different sources (e.g., news, tweets). This model is then further extended for
multitask learning (MTL) of three related tasks: STS, short answer scoring
(SAS) and answer sentence ranking (ASR). In our experiments, the adaptive model
demonstrates better overall cross-domain and cross-task performance over two
non-adaptive baselines.
