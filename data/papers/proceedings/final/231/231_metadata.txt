Abstract#==#State-of-the-art word embeddings, which are often trained on bag-of-words (BOW)
contexts, provide a high quality representation of aspects of the semantics of
nouns. However, their quality decreases substantially for the task of verb
similarity prediction. In this paper we show that using symmetric pattern
contexts (SPs, e.g., "X and Y") improves word2vec verb similarity performance
by up to 15% and is also instrumental in adjective similarity prediction. The
unsupervised SP contexts are even superior to a variety of dependency contexts
extracted using a supervised parser. Moreover, we observe that SPs and
dependency coordination contexts (Coor) capture a similar type of information,
and demonstrate that Coor contexts are superior to other dependency contexts
including the set of all dependency contexts, although they are still inferior
to SPs. Finally, there are substantially fewer SP contexts compared to
alternative representations, leading to a massive reduction in training time.
On an 8G words corpus and a 32 core machine, the SP model trains in 11 minutes,
compared to 5 and 11 hours with BOW and all dependency contexts, respectively.
