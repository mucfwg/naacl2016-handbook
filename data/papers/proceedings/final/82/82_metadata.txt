Abstract#==#We introduce a novel, simple convolution neural network (CNN) architecture -
multi-group norm  constraint  CNN  (MGNC-CNN)â€“  that capitalizes  on 
multiple  sets of  word embeddings for sentence classification.     
MGNC-CNN extracts features from input embedding sets independently and then
joins these at the penultimate layer in the network to form a final  feature 
vector.  We  then  adopt  a  group regularization  strategy  that 
differentially penalizes  weights associated with  the subcomponents generated
from the respective embedding  sets.  This model  is  much 
simpler than comparable  alternative  architectures  and  requires 
substantially less training time.                                      
Furthermore, it is flexible in that it does not require input word embeddings
to be of the same dimensionality.   We show  that  MGNC-CNN consistently
outperforms baseline models.
