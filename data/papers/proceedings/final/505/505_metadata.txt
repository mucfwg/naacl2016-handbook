Abstract#==#Most work on extracting parallel text from comparable corpora depends on
linguistic resources such as seed parallel documents or translation
dictionaries. This paper presents a simple baseline approach for bootstrapping
a parallel collection. It starts by observing documents published on similar
dates and the co-occurrence of a small number of identical tokens across
languages. It then uses fast, online inference for a latent variable model to
represent multilingual documents in a shared topic space where it can do
efficient nearest-neighbor search. Starting from the Gigaword collections in
English and Spanish, we train a translation system that outperforms one trained
on the WMT'11 parallel training set.
