Abstract#==#We introduce the task of cross-lingual lexical entailment, which aims to detect
whether the meaning of a word in one language can be inferred from the meaning
of a word in another language. We construct a gold standard for this task, and
propose an unsupervised solution based on distributional word representations.
As commonly done in the monolingual setting, we assume a word e entails a
word f if the prominent context features of e are a subset of those of f.
To address the challenge of comparing contexts across languages, we propose a
novel method for inducing sparse bilingual word representations from
monolingual and parallel texts. Our approach yields an F-score of 70%, and
significantly outperforms strong baselines based on translation and on existing
word representations.
