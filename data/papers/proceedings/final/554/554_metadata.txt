Abstract#==#When translating into a morphologically complex language, segmenting the target
language can reduce data sparsity, while introducing the complication of
desegmenting the system output. We present a method for decoder-integrated
desegmentation, allowing features that consider the desegmented target, such as
a word-level language model, to be considered throughout the entire search
space. Our results on a large-scale, English to Arabic translation task show
significant improvement over the 1-best desegmentation baseline.
