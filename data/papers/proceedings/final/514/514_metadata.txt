Abstract#==#We describe an LSTM-based model which we call Byte-to-Span (BTS) that reads
text as bytes and outputs span annotations of the form [start, length, label]
where start positions, lengths, and labels are separate entries in our
vocabulary. Because we operate directly on unicode bytes rather than
language-specific words or characters, we can analyze text in many languages
with a single model. Due to the small vocabulary size, these multilingual
models are very compact, but produce results similar to or better than the
state-of- the-art in Part-of-Speech tagging and Named Entity Recognition that
use only the provided training datasets (no external data sources). Our models
are learning “from scratch” in that they do not rely on any elements of the
standard pipeline in Natural Language Processing (including tokenization), and
thus can run in standalone fashion on raw text.
