Abstract#==#There is a significant gap between the performance of a coreference resolution
system on gold mentions and on system mentions. This gap is due to the large
and unbalanced search space in coreference resolution when using system
mentions. In this paper we show that search space pruning is a simple but
efficient way of improving coreference resolvers. By incorporating our pruning
method in one of the state-of-the-art coreference resolution systems, we
achieve the best reported overall score on the CoNLL 2012 English test set. A
version of our pruning method is available with the Cort coreference resolution
source code.
