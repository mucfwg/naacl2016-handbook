Abstract#==#This paper proposes a novel translation-based knowledge graph embedding that
preserves the logical properties of relations such as transitivity and
symmetricity. The embedding space generated by existing translation-based
embeddings do not represent transitive and symmetric relations, because they
ignore the role of entities in triples. Thus, we introduce a role-specific
projection which maps an entity to distinct vectors according to its role in a
triple. That is, a head entity is projected onto an embedding space by a head
projection operator, and a tail entity is projected by a tail projection
operator. This idea is applied to TransE, TransR, and TransD to produce
lppTransE, lppTransR, and lppTransD, respectively. According to the
experimental results on link prediction and triple classification, the proposed
logical property preserving embeddings show the state-of-the-art performance at
both tasks. These results prove that it is critical to preserve logical
properties of relations while embedding knowledge graphs, and the proposed
method does it effectively.
