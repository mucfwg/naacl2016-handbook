Abstract#==#It has been shown that transition-based methods can be used for syntactic word
ordering and tree linearization, achieving significantly faster speed compared
with traditional best-first methods. State-of-the-art transition-based models
give competitive results on abstract word ordering and unlabeled tree
linearization, but significantly worse results on labeled tree linearization.
We demonstrate that the main cause for the performance bottleneck is the
sparsity of SHIFT transition actions rather than heavy pruning. To address this
issue, we propose a modification to the standard transition-based feature
structure, which reduces feature sparsity and allows lookahead features at a
small cost to decoding efficiency. Our model gives the best reported accuracies
on all benchmarks, yet still being over 30 times faster compared with
best-first-search.
