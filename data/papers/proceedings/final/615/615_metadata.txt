Abstract#==#We introduce a latent activity model for workplace
emails, positing that communication at
work is purposeful and organized by activities.
We pose the problem as probabilistic inference
in graphical models that jointly capture
the interplay between latent activities and the
email contexts they govern, such as the recipients,
subject and body. The model parameters
are learned using maximum likelihood estimation
with an expectation maximization algorithm.
We present three variants of the model
that incorporate the recipients, co-occurrence
of the recipients, and email body and subject.
We demonstrate the modelâ€™s effectiveness in
an email recipient recommendation task and
show that it outperforms a state-of-the-art generative
model. Additionally, we show that the
activity model can be used to identify email
senders who engage in similar activities, resulting
in further improvements in recipient
recommendation.
