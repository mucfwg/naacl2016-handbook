Abstract#==#Language generation from purely semantic representations is a challenging task.
This paper addresses generating English from the Abstract Meaning
Representation (AMR), consisting of re-entrant graphs whose nodes are concepts
and edges are relations. The new method is trained statistically from
AMR-annotated English and consists of two major steps: (i) generating an
appropriate spanning tree for the AMR, and (ii) applying tree-to-string
transducers to generate English. The method relies on discriminative learning
and an argument realization model to overcome data sparsity. Initial tests on
held-out data show good promise despite the complexity of the task. The system
is available open-source as part of JAMR at: http://github.com/jflanigan/jamr
