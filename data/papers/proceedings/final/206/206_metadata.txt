Abstract#==#Many languages use honorifics to express politeness, social distance, or the
relative social status between the speaker and their addressee(s). In machine
translation from a language without honorifics such as English, it is difficult
to predict the appropriate honorific, but users may want to control the level
of politeness in the output. In this paper, we perform a pilot study to control
honorifics in neural machine translation (NMT) via side constraints, focusing
on English-German. We show that by marking up the (English) source side of the
training data with a feature that encodes the use of honorifics on the (German)
target side, we can control the honorifics produced at test time. Experiments
show that the choice of honorifics has a big impact on translation quality as
measured by BLEU, and oracle experiments show that substantial improvements are
possible by constraining the translation to the desired level of politeness.
