Abstract#==#We introduce a bootstrapping algorithm for regression that exploits word
embedding models. We use it to infer four psycholinguistic properties of words:
Familiarity, Age of Acquisition, Concreteness and Imagery and further populate
the MRC Psycholinguistic Database with these properties. The approach achieves
0.88 correlation with human-produced values and the inferred psycholinguistic
features lead to state-of-the-art results when used in a Lexical Simplification
task.
