Abstract#==#Word segmentation is usually recognized as the first step for many Chinese
natural language processing tasks, yet its impact on these subsequent tasks is
relatively under-studied. For example, how to solve the {\it mismatch} problem
when applying an existing word segmenter to new data? Does a better word
segmenter yield a better subsequent NLP task performance?
In this work, we conduct an initial attempt to answer these questions on two
related subsequent tasks: semantic slot filling in spoken language
understanding and named entity recognition.
We propose three techniques to solve the mismatch problem: using word
segmentation outputs as additional features, adaptation with partial-learning
and taking advantage of n-best word segmentation list. 
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques for both
tasks and we achieve an error reduction of about 11% for spoken language
understanding and 24% for named entity recognition over the baseline systems.
