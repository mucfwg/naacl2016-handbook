Abstract#==#Events and entities are closely related; entities are often actors or
participants in events and events without entities are uncommon. The
interpretation of events and entities is highly contextually dependent.
Existing work in information extraction typically models events separately from
entities, and performs inference at the sentence level, ignoring the rest of
the document. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that models the
dependencies among variables of events, entities, and their relations, and
performs joint inference of these variables across a document. The goal is to
enable access to document-level contextual information and facilitate
context-aware predictions. We demonstrate that our approach substantially
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for event extraction as well as a
strong baseline for entity extraction.
