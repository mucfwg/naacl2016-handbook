Abstract#==#Current approaches to Information Extraction (IE) are capable of extracting
large amounts of facts with associated probabilities. Because no current IE
system is perfect, complementary and conflicting facts are obtained when
different systems are run over the same data. Knowledge Fusion (KF) is the
problem of aggregating facts from different extractors. Existing methods
approach KF using supervised learning or deep linguistic knowledge, which
either lack sufficient data or are not robust enough. We propose a
semi-supervised application of Consensus Maximization to the KF problem, using
a combination of supervised and unsupervised models. Consensus Maximization
Fusion (CM Fusion) is able to pro- mote high quality facts and eliminate
incorrect ones. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system on the NIST Slot
Filler Validation contest, which seeks to evaluate and aggregate multiple
independent information ex- tractors. Our system achieved the highest F1 score
relative to other system submissions.
