Abstract#==#Neural machine translation (NMT) with recurrent neural networks, 
 has proven to be an effective technique for end-to-end machine translation.
 However, in spite of its promising advances over traditional translation
methods,
 it typically suffers from an issue of unbalanced outputs, that arise from both
 the nature of recurrent neural networks themselves, and the challenges
inherent in machine translation.
 To overcome this issue, we propose an agreement model for neural machine
translation and show 
 its effectiveness on large-scale Japanese-to-English and Chinese-to-English
 translation tasks. Our results show the model can achieve improvements of up
to 1.4 BLEU over the 
 strongest baseline NMT system. Furthermore, this new end-to-end NMT approach
substantially outperformed a
 phrase-based Moses baseline by up to 5.6 BLEU points.
