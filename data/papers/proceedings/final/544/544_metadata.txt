Abstract#==#Coherence is established by semantic connections between sentences of a
text which can be modeled by lexical relations. In this paper, we introduce the
lexical coherence graph (LCG), a new graph-based model to represent lexical
relations among sentences. The frequency of subgraphs (coherence patterns) of
this graph captures the connectivity style of sentence nodes in this graph. The
coherence of a text is encoded by a vector of these frequencies. We evaluate
the LCG model on the readability ranking task. The results of the experiments
show that the LCG model obtains higher accuracy than state-of-the-art coherence
models. Using larger subgraphs yields higher accuracy because they capture
more structural information. However, larger subgraphs can be sparse. We adapt
Kneser-Ney smoothing to smooth subgraphs' frequencies. Smoothing improves
performance.
