Abstract#==#Access to word–sentiment associations is useful for many applications,
including sentiment analysis, stance detection, and linguistic analysis.
However, manually assigning fine-grained sentiment association scores to words
has many challenges with respect to keeping annotations consistent. We apply
the annotation technique of Best–Worst Scaling to obtain real-valued
sentiment association scores for words and phrases in three different domains:
general English, English Twitter, and Arabic Twitter. We show that on all three
domains the ranking of words by sentiment remains remarkably consistent even
when the annotation process is repeated with a different set of annotators. We
also, for the first time, determine the minimum difference in sentiment
association that is perceptible to native speakers of a language.
