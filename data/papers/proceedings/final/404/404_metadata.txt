Abstract#==#Poorly translated text is often disfluent and difficult to read. In contrast,
well-formed translations require less time to process. In this paper, we model
the differences in reading patterns of Machine Translation (MT) evaluators
using novel features extracted from their gaze data, and we learn to predict
the quality scores given by those evaluators. We test our predictions in a
pairwise ranking scenario, measuring Kendall’s tau correlation with the
judgments. We show that our features provide information beyond fluency, and
can be combined with BLEU for better predictions. Furthermore, our results show
that reading patterns can be used to build semi-automatic metrics that
anticipate the scores given by the evaluators.
