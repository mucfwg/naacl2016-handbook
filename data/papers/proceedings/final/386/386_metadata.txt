Abstract#==#We present a fast, simple and high-accuracy short answer grading system. Given
a short-answer question and its correct answer, key measures of the correctness
of a student response can be derived from its semantic similarity with the
correct answer. Our supervised model (1) utilizes recent advances in the
identification of short-text similarity, and (2) augments text similarity
features with key grading-specific constructs. We present experimental results
where our model demonstrates top performance on multiple benchmarks.
