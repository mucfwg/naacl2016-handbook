Abstract#==#We explore the consequences of representing token segmentations as hierarchical
structures (trees) for the task of Multiword Expression (MWE) recognition, in
isolation or in combination with dependency parsing. We propose a novel
representation of token segmentation as trees on tokens, resembling dependency
trees. Given this new representation, we present and evaluate two different
architectures to combine MWE recognition and dependency parsing in the
easy-first framework: a pipeline and a joint system, both taking advantage of
lexical and syntactic dimensions. We experimentally validate that MWE
recognition significantly helps syntactic parsing.
