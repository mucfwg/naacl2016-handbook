Abstract#==#We present an approach to the new task of opinion holder and target extraction
on opinion compounds. Opinion compounds (e.g. "user rating" or "victim
support") are noun compounds whose head is an opinion noun. We do not only
examine features known to be effective for noun compound analysis, such as
paraphrases and semantic classes of heads and modifiers, but also propose novel
features tailored to this new task. Among them, we examine paraphrases that
jointly consider holders and targets, a verb detour in which noun heads are
replaced by related verbs, a global head constraint allowing inferencing
between different compounds, and the categorization of the sentiment view that
the head conveys.
