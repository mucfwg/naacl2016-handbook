Abstract#==#In this paper, we present a straightforward strategy for transferring
dependency parsers across languages.  The proposed method learns a parser from
partially annotated data obtained through the projection of annotations across
unambiguous word alignments. It does not rely on any modeling of the
reliability of dependency and/or alignment links and is therefore easy to
implement and parameter free.  Experiments on six languages show that our
method is at par with recent algorithmically demanding methods, at a much
cheaper computational cost. It can thus serve as a fair baseline for
transferring dependencies across languages with the use of parallel corpora.
