Abstract#==#We introduce a new task, visual sense disambiguation for verbs: given an image
and a verb, assign the correct sense of the verb, i.e., the one that describes
the action depicted in the image. Just as textual word sense disambiguation is
useful for a wide range of NLP tasks, visual sense disambiguation can be useful
for
multimodal tasks such as image retrieval, image description, and text
illustration. We introduce VerSe, a new dataset that augments existing
multimodal datasets (COCO and TUHOI) with sense labels. We propose an
unsupervised
algorithm based on Lesk which performs visual sense disambiguation using
textual, vi-
sual, or multimodal embeddings. We find that textual embeddings perform well
when gold-
standard textual annotations (object labels and image descriptions) are
available, while multimodal embeddings perform well on unannotated images. We
also verify our findings by
using the textual and multimodal embeddings as features in a supervised setting
and analyse
the performance of visual sense disambiguation task. VerSe is made publicly
available
and can be downloaded at: https://github.com/spandanagella/verse.
