Abstract#==#Automated geolocation of social media messages can benefit a variety of
downstream applications.
However, these geolocation systems are typically evaluated without attention to
how changes in time impact geolocation. Since different people, in different
locations write messages
at different times, these factors can significantly vary the performance of a
geolocation system over time.
We demonstrate cyclical temporal effects on geolocation
accuracy in Twitter, as well as rapid drops as test data moves beyond the time
period of training data. We show
that temporal drift can effectively be countered with even modest online model
updates.
