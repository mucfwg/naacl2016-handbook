Abstract#==#This paper provides a binary, token-based classification of German particle
verbs (PVs) into literal vs. non-literal usage. A random forest improving
standard features (e.g., bag-of-words; affective ratings) with PV-specific
information and abstraction over common nouns significantly outperforms the
majority baseline. In addition, PV-specific classification experiments
demonstrate the role of shared particle semantics and semantically related base
verbs in PV meaning shifts.
