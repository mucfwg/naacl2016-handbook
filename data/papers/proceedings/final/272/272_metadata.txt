Abstract#==#Existing research on multiclass text classification mostly makes the closed
world assumption, which focuses on designing accurate classifiers under the
assumption that all test classes are known at training time. A more realistic
scenario is to expect unseen classes during testing (open world). In this case,
the goal is to design a learning system that classifies documents of the known
classes into their respective classes and also to reject documents from unknown
classes. This problem is called open (world) classification. This paper
approaches the problem by reducing the open space risk while balancing the
empirical risk. It proposes to use a new learning strategy, called center-based
similarity (CBS) space learning (or CBS learning), to provide a novel solution
to the problem. Extensive experiments across two datasets show that CBS
learning gives promising results on multiclass open text classification
compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
