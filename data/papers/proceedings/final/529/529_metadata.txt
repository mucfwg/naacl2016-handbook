Abstract#==#Sequence-to-sequence neural network models
for generation of conversational responses tend
to generate safe, commonplace responses (e.g.,
I donâ€™t know) regardless of the input. We suggest
that the traditional objective function, i.e.,
the likelihood of output (response) given input
(message) is unsuited to response generation
tasks. Instead we propose using Maximum Mutual
Information (MMI) as the objective function
in neural models. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed MMI models
produce more diverse, interesting, and appropriate
responses, yielding substantive gains in
BLEU scores on two conversational datasets
and in human evaluations.
