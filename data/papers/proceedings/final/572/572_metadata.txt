Abstract#==#Instantiation is a fairly common discourse relation and past work has suggested
that it plays special roles in local coherence, in sentiment expression and in
content selection in summarization. In this paper we provide the first
systematic corpus analysis of the relation and show that relation-specific
features can improve considerably the detection of the relation.  We show that
sentences involved in Instantiation are set apart from other sentences by the
use of gradable (subjective) adjectives, the occurrence of rare words and by
different patterns in part of speech use. Words across arguments of
Instantiation are connected through hypernym and meronym relations
significantly more often than in other sentences and that they stand out in
context by being significantly less similar to each other than other adjacent
sentence pairs. These factors provide substantial predictive power that
improves the identification of Instantiation by more than 5% F-measure.
