Abstract#==#Artificial neural networks are powerful models, which have been widely applied
into many aspects of machine translation, such as language modeling and
translation modeling. Though notable improvements have been made in these
areas, the reordering problem still remains a challenge in statistical machine
translations. In this paper, we present a novel neural reordering model that
directly models word pairs and their alignment. Further by utilizing LSTM
recurrent neural networks, much longer context could be learned for reordering
prediction. Experimental results on NIST OpenMT12 Arabic-English and
Chinese-English 1000-best rescoring task show that our LSTM neural reordering
feature is robust, and achieves significant improvements over various baseline
systems.
