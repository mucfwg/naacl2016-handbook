Abstract#==#We propose recurrent support vector machine(RSVM) for slot tagging. This model
is a combination of the recurrent neural network (RNN) and the structured
support vector machine. RNN extracts features from the input sequence. The
structured support vector machine uses a sequence-level discriminative
objective function. The proposed model therefore combines the sequence
representation capability of an RNN with the sequence-level discriminative
objective. We have observed new state-of-the-art results on two benchmark
datasets and one private dataset. RSVM obtained statistical significant 4% and
2% relative average F1 score improvement on ATIS dataset and Chunking dataset,
respectively. Out of eight domains in Cortana live log dataset, RSVM achieved
F1 score improvement on seven domains. Experiments also show that RSVM
significantly speeds up the model training by skipping the weight updating for
non-support vector training samples, compared against training using RNN with
CRF or minimum cross-entropy objectives.
