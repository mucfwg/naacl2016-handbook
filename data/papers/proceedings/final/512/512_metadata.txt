Abstract#==#Research on grammatical error correction has received considerable attention.
For dealing with all types of errors, grammatical error correction methods that
employ statistical machine translation (SMT) have been proposed in recent
years. An SMT system generates candidates with scores for all candidates and
selects the sentence with the highest score as the correction result. However,
the 1-best result of an SMT system is not always the best result. Thus, we
propose a reranking approach for grammatical error correction. The reranking
approach is used to re-score N-best results of the SMT and reorder the results.
Our experiments show that our reranking system using parts of speech and
syntactic features improves performance and achieves state-of-the-art quality,
with an F0:5 score of 40.0.
