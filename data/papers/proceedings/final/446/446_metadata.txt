Abstract#==#Idioms pose a great challenge to natural language understanding. A system that
can automatically paraphrase idioms in context has applications in many NLP
tasks. This paper proposes a phrasal substitution method to replace idioms with
their figurative meanings in literal English. Our approach identifies relevant
replacement phrases from an idiom's dictionary definition and performs
appropriate grammatical and referential transformations to ensure that the
idiom substitution fits seamlessly into the original context. The proposed
method has been evaluated both by automatic metrics and human judgments.Results
suggest that high quality paraphrases of idiomatic expressions can be
achieved.
