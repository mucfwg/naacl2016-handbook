Abstract#==#Universal schema builds a knowledge base (KB) of entities and relations by
jointly embedding all relation types from input KBs as well as textual patterns
observed in raw text. In most previous applications of universal schema, each
textual pattern is represented as a single embedding, preventing generalization
to unseen patterns. Recent work employs a neural network to capture patternsâ€™
compositional semantics, providing generalization to all possible input text.
In response, this paper introduces significant further improvements to the
coverage and flexibility of universal schema relation extraction: predictions
for entities unseen in training and multilingual transfer learning to domains
with no annotation. We evaluate our model through extensive experiments on the
English and Spanish TAC KBP benchmark, outperforming the top system from TAC
2013 slot-filling using no handwritten patterns or additional annotation. We
also consider a multilingual setting in which English training data entities
overlap with the seed KB, but Spanish text does not. Despite having no
annotation for Spanish data, we train an accurate predictor, with additional
improvements obtained by tying word embeddings across languages. Furthermore,
we find that multilingual training improves English relation extraction
accuracy. Our approach is thus suited to broad-coverage automated knowledge
base construction in a variety of languages and domains.
