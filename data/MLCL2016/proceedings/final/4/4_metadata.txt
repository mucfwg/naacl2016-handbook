Abstract#==#Treebanks have recently been released for a number of languages with the
harmonized annotation created by the Universal Dependencies project. The
representation of certain constructions in UD are known to be suboptimal for
parsing and may be worth transforming for the purpose of parsing. In this
paper, we focus on the representation of verb groups. Several studies have
shown that parsing works better when auxiliaries are the head of auxiliary
dependency relations which is not the case in UD. We therefore transformed verb
groups in UD treebanks, parsed the test set and transformed it back, and
contrary to expectations, observed significant decreases in accuracy. We
provide suggestive evidence that improvements in previous studies were obtained
because the transformation helps disambiguating POS tags of main verbs and
auxiliaries. The question of why parsing accuracy decreases with this approach
in the case of UD is left open.
