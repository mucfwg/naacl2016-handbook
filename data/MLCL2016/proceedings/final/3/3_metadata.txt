Abstract#==#We present a matrix factorization model for learning cross-lingual
representations. Using sentence-aligned corpora, the proposed model learns
distributed representations by factoring the given data into language-dependent
factors and one shared factor. Moreover, the model can quickly learn shared
representations for more than two languages without undermining the quality of
the monolingual components. The model achieves an accuracy of 88%  on English
to German cross-lingual document classification, and 0.8 Pearson correlation on
Spanish-English cross-lingual semantic textual similarity. While the results do
not beat state-of-the-art performance in these tasks, we show that the
crosslingual models are at least as good as their monolingual counterparts.
