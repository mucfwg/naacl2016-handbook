Abstract#==#We tackle the challenge of learning part-of-speech classified translations as
part of an inversion transduction grammar, by learning translations for English
words with known part-of-speech tags, both from existing translation lexica and
from parallel corpora. When translating from a low resource language into
English, we can expect to have rich resources for English, such as treebanks,
and small amounts of bilingual resources, such as translation lexica and
parallel corpora. We solve the problem of integrating these heterogeneous
resources into a single model using stochastic Inversion Transduction Grammars,
which we augment with wildcards to handle unknown translations.
