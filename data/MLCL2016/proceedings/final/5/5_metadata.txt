Abstract#==#In this paper, we propose to analyze the pre- and post-processing steps applied
in the context of cross-lingual dependency transfer. To this aim, we employ a
simple transfer strategy that operates on partially annotated projected data.
We show that a good data selection strategy is a key point in successfully
transferring dependencies and that better data selection techniques need to be
developed in order to achieve the performance of fully supervised methods.
