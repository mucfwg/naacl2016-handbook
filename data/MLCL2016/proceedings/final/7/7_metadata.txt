Abstract#==#Researchers have shown that a wordnet for a new language, possibly
resource-poor, can be constructed automatically by translating wordnets of
resource-rich languages. The quality of these constructed wordnets is affected
by the quality of the resources used such as dictionaries and translation
methods in the construction process. Recent work shows that vector
representation of words (word embeddings) can be used to discover related words
in text. In this paper, we propose a method that performs such similarity
computation using word embeddings to improve the quality of automatically
constructed wordnets.
