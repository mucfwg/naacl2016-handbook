Abstract#==#Emotional language of human individuals has been studied for quite a while
dealing with opinions and value judgments people have and share with others. In
our work, we take a different stance and investigate whether large
organizations, such as major industrial players, have and communicate emotions,
as well. Such an anthropomorphic perspective has recently been advocated in
management and organization studies which consider organizations as social
actors. We studied this assumption by analyzing 1,676 annual business and
sustainability reports from 90 top-performing enterprises in the United States,
Great Britain and Germany. We compared the measurements of emotions in this
homogeneous corporate text corpus with those from RCV1, a heterogeneous Reuters
newswire corpus. From this, we gathered empirical evidence that business
reports compare well with typical emotion-neutral economic news, whereas
sustainability reports are much more emotionally loaded, similar to
emotion-heavy sports and fashion news from Reuters. Furthermore, our data
suggest that these emotions are distinctive and relatively stable over time per
organization, thus constituting an emotional profile for enterprises.
