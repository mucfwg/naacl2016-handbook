Abstract#==#In this paper, we study the performance of N-gram language models on
classification tasks such as sentiment analysis and spam detection and evaluate
the effect of prior probability estimates on the results. Our data is in the
form of public online posts pertaining to fast fashion brands, from different
social media channels (Twitter and Facebook).We propose a novel ensemble model
based on the combination of different N-grams in order to deal with the
heteroskedastic nature of data collected from these social media channels. This
has been further extended to increase the efficacy of the classification
results
