Abstract#==#Clinical research article summaries called infoPOEMs (Patient-Oriented Evidence
that Matters) are emailed by the Canadian Medical Association to family
physicians who read them and answer the online Information Assessment Method
(IAM) questionnaire which a free form textual opinion fields to comment on the
value or content of the infoPOEM. This article presents results of a relevance
evaluation study applied on these comments to automatically determine their
helpfulness and consequently the interest of sharing them among the medical
community. A dataset of 3,470 manually annotated comments provides a gold
standard, containing structural, syntactic, and semantic features taken from
the Unified Medical Language System and IAM questionnaire. Applied machine
learning algorithms show a global f-measure improvement of 9.1\% when compared
to a binary occurrence bag-of-word baseline.
