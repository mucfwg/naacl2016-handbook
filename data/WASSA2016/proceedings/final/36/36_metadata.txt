Abstract#==#Sentences and tweets are often annotated for
sentiment simply by asking respondents to label
them as positive, negative, or neutral. This
works well for simple expressions of sentiment;
however, for many other types of sentences,
respondents are unsure of how to annotate,
and produce inconsistent labels. In this
paper, we outline several types of sentences
that are particularly challenging for manual
sentiment annotation. Next we propose two
annotation schemes that address these challenges,
and list benefits and limitations for
both.
