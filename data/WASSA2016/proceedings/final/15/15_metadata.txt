Abstract#==#Existing opinion analysis techniques rely on the clues within the sentence that
focus on the sentiment analysis task itself. However, the sentiment analysis
task is not isolated from other NLP tasks (co-reference resolution, entity
linking, etc) but they can benefit each other. In this paper, we define
dependencies between sentiment analysis and other tasks, and express the
dependencies in first order logic rules regardless of the representations of
different tasks. The conceptual framework using such dependency rules as
constraints aims at exploiting information outside the sentence and outside the
document to improve sentiment analysis. Further, the framework allows exception
to the rules.
