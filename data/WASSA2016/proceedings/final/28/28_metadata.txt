Abstract#==#Access to expressions of subjective personal posts increased with the
popularity of Social Media. However, most of the work in sentiment analysis
focuses on predicting only valence from text and usually targeted at a product,
rather than affective states. In this paper, we introduce a new data set of
2895 Social Media posts rated by two psychologically-trained annotators on two
separate ordinal nine-point scales. These scales represent valence (or
sentiment) and arousal (or intensity), which defines each post’s position on
the circumplex model of affect, a well-established system for describing
emotional states (Russell, 1980; Posner et al., 2005). The data set is used to
train prediction models for each of the two dimensions from text which achieve
high predictive accuracy – correlated at r = .65 with valence and r = .85
with arousal annotations. Our data set offers a building block to a deeper
study of personal affect as expressed in social media. This can be used in
applications such as mental illness detection or in automated large-scale
psychological studies.
