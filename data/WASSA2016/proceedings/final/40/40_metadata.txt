Abstract#==#Does sharing moral values encourage people to connect
and form communities? The importance of
moral homophily (love of same) has been recognized
by social scientists, but the types of moral
similarities that drive this phenomenon are still unknown.
In this talk, I will present a series of experiments
(both large-scale, observational social-media
analyses and behavioral lab experiments) that investigate
which types of moral similarities influence tie
formations. Our results indicate that social network
processes reflect moral selection, and both online
and offline differences in moral purity concerns are
particularly predictive of social distance.
