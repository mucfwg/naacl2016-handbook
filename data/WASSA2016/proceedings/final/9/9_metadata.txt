Abstract#==#This work presents a novel approach for automatic creation of sentiment word
lists. In this approach, words are first mapped into a continuous latent space,
which serves as input to a multilayer perceptron (MLP) trained using
sentiment-annotated words. When evaluated using manually annotated EmoLex
corpus, our approach compares favourably with SentiWordNet 3.0, another
automatically generated word list.
