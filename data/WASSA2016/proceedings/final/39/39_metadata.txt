Abstract#==#Affective computing has a commercial side. Numerous
products and projects provide sentiment, emotion,
and intent extraction capabilities, applied in
consumer and financial markets, for healthcare and
customer care, and for media, policy, and politics.
Academic and industry researchers are naturally interested
how sentiment and social technologies are
being applied and in commercial market opportunities
and trends, in what’s being funded, what’s
falling flat, and what’s on business’s roadmap. Analyst
Seth Grimes will provide an industry overview,
surveying companies and applications in the sentiment
and social analytics spaces as well as work at
the tech giants. He will discuss commercialization
strategy and the affective market outlook.
