Abstract#==#This work explores the relationship between the sentiment of lyrics in
Billboard Top 100 songs, stocks, and a consumer confidence index. We
hypothesized that sentiment of Top 100 songs could be representative of public
mood and correlate to stock market changes as well. We analyzed the sentiment
for polarity and mood in terms of seven dimensions. We gathered data from 2008
to 2013 and found statistically significant correlations between lyrical
sentiment polarity and DJIA closing values and between anxiety in lyrics and
consumer confidence. We also found strong Granger-causal relationships
involving anxiety, hope, anger, and both societal indicators. Finally, we
introduced a vector autoregression model with time lag which is able to capture
stock and consumer confidence indices (R-squared=.97, p<.001 and
R-squared=0.72, p<.01 respectively).
