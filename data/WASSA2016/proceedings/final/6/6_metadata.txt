Abstract#==#Web discussion forums typically contain posts that fall into different
categories such as question, solution, feedback, spam, etc. Automatic
identification of these categories can aid information retrieval that is
tailored for specific user requirements. Previously, a number of supervised
methods have attempted to solve this problem; however, these depend on the
availability of abundant training data. A few existing unsupervised and
semi-supervised approaches are either focused on identifying only one or two
categories, or do not discuss category-specific performance. In contrast, this
work proposes methods for identifying multiple categories, and also analyzes
the category-specific performance. These methods are based on sequence models
(specifically, hidden Markov Models) that can model language for each category
using both probabilistic word and part-of-speech information, and minimal
manually specified features. The unsupervised version initializes the models
using clustering, whereas the semi-supervised version uses few manually labeled
forum posts. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that these methods are more
accurate than previous ones.
