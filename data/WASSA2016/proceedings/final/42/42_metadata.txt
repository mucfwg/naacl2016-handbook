Abstract#==#Emotions are not linguistic entities but they are
conveniently expressed through the language. Feelings
influence actions, thoughts and of course our
way of communicate.
It was more than twelve years ago that we developed
WordNet-Affect (Strapparava and Valitutti,
2004), and I remember that at that time several people
questioned about the utility and even the possibility
of studying emotions using computational linguistics
techniques. In the recent years, nonetheless
there has been a flourishing interest in automatically
detecting and generating emotions in texts,
with many valuable research contributions by the
community. The space here is too short to think
to even shortly mention and review them. Anyway
I would like to indicate which directions are more
promising in my opinion.
