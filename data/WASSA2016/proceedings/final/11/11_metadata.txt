Abstract#==#A reputation system assists people selecting
whom to trust. The “all good reputation”
problem is common in e-commerce domain,
making it difficult for buyers to choose cred-
ible sellers. Observing high growth of on-
line data in Hindi language, in this paper, we
propose a reputation system in this language.
The functions of this system include 1) review
mining for different criteria of online transac-
tions 2) calculation of reputation rating and
reputation weight for each criteria from user
reviews and 3) ranking sellers based on com-
puted reputation score. Extensive simulations
conducted on eBay dataset show its effective-
ness in solving “all good reputation” problem.
So far as our knowledge is concerned, this is
the first work in Hindi language on reputation
system.
