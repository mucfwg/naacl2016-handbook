Abstract#==#Traditional sentiment analysis has been focused on predicting the polarity of
texts as positive or negative at different granularity. This broad
categorization does not account for informativeness of the underlying text. For
many real-world applications such as social listening, brand monitoring and
e-commerce platforms, the opinions that really matter are the informative
opinions describing why something is good or bad. In this paper, we try to
understand the properties of complaints and praises which is an informative
subset of the negative and positive categories. Our analysis in the context of
user reviews shows that complaints and praises have distinct properties that
differentiate it from positive only or negative only sentences.
