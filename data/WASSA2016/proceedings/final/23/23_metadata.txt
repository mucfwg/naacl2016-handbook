Abstract#==#Motivated by recent advances in the area of Compositional Distributional
Semantic Models (CDSMs), we propose a compositional approach for estimating
continuous affective ratings for adjective-noun (AN)
and noun-noun (NN) pairs. The ratings are computed for the three basic
dimensions of continuous affective spaces, namely, valence, arousal and dom-
inance. We propose that similarly to the semantic modification that underlies
CDSMs, affective modification may occur within the framework of affective
spaces, especially when the constituent words of the linguistic structures
under investigation form modifier-head pairs (e.g., AN and NN). The affective
content of the entire structure is determined from the interaction between the
respective constituents, i.e., the affect conveyed by the head is altered by
the
modifier. In addition, we investigate the fusion of the proposed model with the
semantic-affective model proposed in (Malandrakis et al., 2013) applied both
at word- and phrase-level. The automatically computed affective ratings were
evaluated against human ratings in terms of correlation. The most accurate
estimates are achieved via fusion 
and absolute performance improvement up to 5% and 4% is reported for NN and AN,
respectively.
