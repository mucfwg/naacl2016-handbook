Abstract#==#People often use social media to discuss opinions, including political ones. We
refer to relevant topics in these discussions as political issues, and the
alternate stands towards these topics as political positions. We present a
Political Issue Extraction (PIE) model that is capable of discovering political
issues and positions from an unlabeled dataset of tweets. A strength of this
model is that it uses twitter timelines of political and non-political authors,
and affiliation information of only political authors. The model estimates
word-specific distributions (that denote political issues and positions) and
hierarchical author/group-specific distributions (that show how these issues
divide people). Our experiments using a dataset of 2.4 million tweets from the
US show that this model effectively captures the desired properties (with
respect to words and groups) of political discussions. We also evaluate
the two components of the model by experimenting with: (a) Use to alternate
strategies to classify words, and (b) Value addition due to incorporation of
group membership information. Estimated distributions are then used to predict
political affiliation with 68\% accuracy.
