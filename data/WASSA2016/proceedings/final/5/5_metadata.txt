Abstract#==#This paper analyzes the suitability of the standard naïve Bayes classifier for
approaching the early classification problem, that is, determining the category
of a document by using partial information only. Specifically, we assess its
performance when classifying documents after seeing  an increasingly number of
terms. A modification to the standard naïve Bayes allows us to make
predictions with partial information. To the best of our knowledge Naïve Bayes
has not been used for this purpose before. Throughout an extensive experimental
evaluation we show the effectiveness of the classifier for early text
classification. We also show that this simple solution is very competitive when
compared with state of the art methodologies that are more elaborated.
