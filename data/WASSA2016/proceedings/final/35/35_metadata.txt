Abstract#==#Among the many challenges that sentiment analysis
(SA) faces, I want to concentrate on one which has
not received much attention within the SA community,
but that is going to play a major role in future
applications: Sentiment Quantification (SQ) (Esuli
and Sebastiani, 2010). Quantification is defined as
the task of estimating the prevalence (i.e., relative
frequency) of the classes of interest in a set of unlabelled
data via supervised learning (Forman, 2008);
examples of SQ are (i) determining the prevalence
of endorsements in a set of tweets about a political
candidate, or (ii) determining the prevalence of rebuttals
in a set of reviews of a given book. A na¨ıve
way to tackle quantification is by classifying each
unlabelled item independently and computing the
fraction of such items that have been attributed the
class. However, a good classifier is not necessarily
a good quantifier: assuming the binary case, even if
(FP +FN) is comparatively small, bad quantification
accuracy results if FP and FN are significantly
different (since perfect quantification coincides with
the case FP = FN). This has led researchers to
study quantification as a task on its own right, rather
than as a byproduct of classification.
