Abstract#==#Precise semantic representation of a sentence and definitive information
extraction are key steps in the accurate processing of sentence meaning,
especially for figurative phenomena such as sarcasm, Irony, and metaphor cause
literal meanings to be discounted and secondary or extended meanings to be
intentionally profiled. Semantic modelling faces a new challenge in social
media, because grammatical inaccuracy is commonplace yet many previous
state-of-the-art methods exploit grammatical structure. For sarcasm detection
over social media content, researchers so far have counted on
Bag-of-Words(BOW), N-grams etc. In this paper, we propose a neural network
semantic model for the task of sarcasm detection. We also review semantic
modelling using Support Vector Machine (SVM) that employs constituency
parse-trees fed and labeled with syntactic and semantic information. The
proposed neural network model composed of Convolution Neural Network(CNN) and
followed by a Long short term memory (LSTM) network and finally a Deep neural
network(DNN). The proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art text-based
methods for sarcasm detection, yielding an F-score of .92.
