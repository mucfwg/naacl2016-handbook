Abstract#==#For aspect-level sentiment analysis, the important
first step is to identify the aspects and their associated entities
from customer reviews. Aspects can be either explicit or implicit,
where the identification of the latter is more difficult. For restaurant
reviews, this difficulty is escalated due to the vast number of
entities and aspects present in reviews. The existing work for
implicit aspect identification in restaurant reviews has the limitation of
choosing at most one implicit aspect for each sentence.
Furthermore, they deal with only a limited set of aspects related
to restaurant reviews. This paper presents a novel approach for
implicit aspect detection, which overcomes these two limitations.
Our approach yields an F1-measure of 0.842 for a set of restaurant reviews
collected from Yelp.
