Abstract#==#This document describes Tree Kernel-SVM based methods for  identifying 
sentences that could be improved in scientific text. This has the goal of
contribute to the body of knowledge that attempt to build assistive tools to
aid scientist improve the quality of their writings.
Our methods consist of a combination of the output multiple support vector
machines which use Tree Kernel computations. Therefore, features for individual
sentences are trees that reflect their grammatical structure.
For the AESW 2016 Shared Task we built systems that provide probabilistic and 
binary outputs by using these models for trees comparisons.
