Abstract#==#Many grammatical error correction approaches use classifiers with
specially-engineered features to predict corrections. A simpler alternative is
to use n-gram language model scores. Rozovskaya and Roth (2011) reported that
classifiers outperformed a language modeling approach.                    Here, we
report a
more
nuanced result: a classifier approach yielded results with higher precision
while a language modeling approach provided better recall. Most importantly, we
found that a combined approach using a logistic regression ensemble
outperformed both a classifier and a language modeling approach.
