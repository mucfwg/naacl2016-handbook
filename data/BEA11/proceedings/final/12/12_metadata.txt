Abstract#==#We present an automated method for estimating the difficulty of spoken texts
for use in generating items that assess non-native learners' listening
proficiency. We collected information on the perceived difficulty of listening
to various English monologue speech samples using a Likert-scale questionnaire
distributed to 15 non-native English learners. We averaged the overall rating
provided by three non-native learners at different proficiency levels into an
overall score of listenability. We then trained a multiple linear regression
model with the listenability score as the dependent variable and features from
both natural language and speech processing as the independent variables. Our
method demonstrated a correlation of 0.76 with the listenability score,
comparable to the agreement between the non-native learners' ratings and the
listenability score.
