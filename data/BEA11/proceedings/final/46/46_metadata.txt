Abstract#==#I investigate Russian second language readability assessment using a
machine-learning approach with a range of lexical, morphological, syntactic,
and discourse features. Testing the model with a new collection of Russian L2
readability corpora achieves an F-score of 0.671 and adjacent accuracy 0.919 on
a 6-level classification task. Information gain and feature subset evaluation
shows that morphological features are collectively the most informative.
Learning curves for binary classifiers reveal that fewer training data are
needed to distinguish between beginning reading levels than are needed to
distinguish between intermediate reading levels.
