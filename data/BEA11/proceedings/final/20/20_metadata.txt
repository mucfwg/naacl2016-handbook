Abstract#==#As many as two-thirds of individuals with an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
also have language impairments, which can range from mild limitations to
complete non-verbal behavior. For such cases, there are several augmentative
and alternative communication (AAC) devices available. These are
computer-designed tools in order to help people with ASD to palliate or
overcome such limitations, at least partially. Some of the most popular AAC
devices are based on pictograms, so that a pictogram is the graphical
representation
of a simple concept and sentences are composed by concatenating a number of
such pictograms. Usually, these tools have to manage a vocabulary made up of
several hundred of pictograms/concepts, with no or very poor
knowledge of the language at semantic and pragmatic level. In this paper we
present Pictogrammar, an AAC system which takes advantage of SUpO and
PictOntology. SUpO (Simple Upper Ontology) is a formal semantic ontology which
is made up of detailed knowledge of facts of everyday life such as simple
words, with special interest in linguistic issues. PictOntology is an ontology
developed to manage sets of pictograms, linked to SUpO.
Both ontologies make possible the development of tools which are able to take
advantage of a formal semantic.
