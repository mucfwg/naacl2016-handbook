Abstract#==#Natural language processing (NLP) methodologies have been widely adopted for
readability assessment and greatly enhanced predictive accuracy. In the present
study, we study a well-established feature, the frequency of a word in common
language use, and systematically explore how such a word-level feature is best
used to characterize the reading levels of texts, a text-level classification
problem. While traditionally such word-level features are simply averaged for  
all words of given text, we show that a richer representation leads to
significantly better predictive models.

A basic approach adding a feature for the standard deviation already shows
clear gains, and two more complex options systematically integrating more
frequency information are explored: (i) encoding separate means for the words
of a text according to which frequency band of the language they occur in, and
(ii) encoding the mean of each cluster of words obtained by agglomerative
hierarchical clustering of the words in the text based on their frequency. The
former organizes frequency around general language characteristics, whereas the
latter aims to lose as little information as possible about the distribution of
word frequencies in a given text. To investigate the generalizability of the
results, we compare cross-validation experiments within a corpus with
cross-corpus experiments testing on the Common Core State Standards reference
texts. We also contrast two different frequency norms and compare frequency
with a measure of contextual diversity.
