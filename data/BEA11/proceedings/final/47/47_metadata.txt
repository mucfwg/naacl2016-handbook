Abstract#==#Online, open access, high-quality textbooks are an exciting new resource for
improving the online learning experience. 
Because textbooks contain carefully crafted  material written in a logical
order, with terms defined before use and discussed in detail, they can provide
foundational material with which to buttress other resources.  As a first step
towards this goal, we explore the automated augmentation of a popular online
learning resource -- Khan Academy video modules -- with relevant reference
chapters from open access textbooks.  We show results from standard information
retrieval weighting and ranking methods as well as an NLP-inspired approach,
achieving F1 scores ranging from 0.63, to 0.83 on science topics.  Future work
includes taking into account the difficulty level and prerequisites of a
textbook to select sections that are both relevant and reflect the concepts
that the reader has already encountered.
