Abstract#==#The automated scoring of second-language
(L2) learner text along various writing 
dimensions is an increasingly active research area.
In this paper, we focus on determining the topical 
relevance of an essay to the prompt that
elicited it. Given the burden involved in manually 
assigning scores for use in training supervised 
prompt-relevance models, we develop
unsupervised models and show that they 
correlate well with human judgements.

We show that expanding prompts using
topically-related words, via pseudo-relevance
modelling, is beneficial and outperforms other
distributional techniques. Finally, we incorporate 
our prompt-relevance models into a supervised 
essay scoring system that predicts a
holistic score and show that it improves its
performance.
