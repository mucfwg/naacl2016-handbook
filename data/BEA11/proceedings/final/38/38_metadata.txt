Abstract#==#We investigate automatically extracting multi-word topical components to
replace information currently provided by experts that is used to score the
Evidence dimension of a writing in response to text assessment. Our goal is to
reduce the amount of expert effort and improve the scalability of an automatic
scoring system. Experimental results show that scoring performance using
automatically extracted data-driven topical components is promising.
