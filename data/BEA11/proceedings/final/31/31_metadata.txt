Abstract#==#How can second language teachers retrieve texts that are rich in terms of the
grammatical constructions to be taught, but also address the content of
interest to the learners? We developed an Information Retrieval system that
identifies the 87 grammatical constructions spelled out in the official English
language curriculum of schools in Baden-Wu ̈rttemberg (Germany) and reranks
the search results based on the selected (de)prioritization of grammatical
forms. In combination with a visualization of the characteristics of the search
results, the approach effectively supports teachers in prioritizing those texts
that provide the targeted forms.
The approach facilitates systematic input enrichment for language learners as a
complement to the established notion of input enhancement: while input
enrichment aims at richly representing the selected forms and categories in a
text, input enhancement targets their presentation to make them more salient
and support noticing.
