Abstract#==#We investigate questions of how to reason about learner meaning in cases where
the set of correct meanings is never entirely complete, specifically for the
case of picture description tasks (PDTs). To operationalize this, we explore
different models of representing and scoring non-native speaker (NNS) responses
to a picture, including bags of dependencies, automatically determining the
relevant parts of an image from a set of native speaker (NS) responses. In more
exploratory work, we examine the variability in both NS and NNS responses, and
how different system parameters correlate with the variability. In this way, we
hope to provide insight for future system development, data collection, and
investigations into learner language.
