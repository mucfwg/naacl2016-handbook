Abstract#==#We applied two standard, open source tools for detecting spelling and grammar
errors to the AESW 2016 shared task: After the Deadline and LanguageTool. The
tools' output was combined with a Maximum Entropy machine learning model to
classify each input sentence as requiring or not requiring any edits. This
approach yielded the second-highest precision of 64.41% in the binary
estimation task at AESW 2016, but also the lowest recall of 36.85%, resulting
in an F-Measure of 46.34%.
