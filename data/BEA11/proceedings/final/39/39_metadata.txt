Abstract#==#In this paper, we describe the development of a morphological analyzer for
learner Hungarian, outlining extensions to a resource-light system that can be
developed by different types of experts. Specifically, we discuss linguistic
rule writing, resource creation, and different system settings, and our
evaluation showcases the amount of improvement one gets for differing levels
and kinds of effort, enabling other researchers to spend their time and energy
as effectively as possible.
