Abstract#==#We present preliminary work on automatically scoring constructed responses
elicited as part of a certification test designed to measure the effectiveness
of the test-taker as a K-12 music teacher. This content scoring differs from
most previous work in that the responses are relatively long and are written by
an adult population of generally proficient English writers. We obtain
reasonably good scoring performance for all the test questions using simple
features. We carry out some initial error analysis and show that there is still
room for improvement.
