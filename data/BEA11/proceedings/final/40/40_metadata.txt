Abstract#==#We present a novel situational task that integrates collaborative problem
solving behavior with testing in a science domain. Participants engage in
discourse, which is used to evaluate their collaborative skills. We present
initial experiments for automatic classification of such discourse, using a
novel classification schema. Considerable accuracy is achieved with just
lexical features. A speech-act classifier, trained on out-of-domain data, can
also be helpful.
