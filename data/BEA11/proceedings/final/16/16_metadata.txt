Abstract#==#We develop a supervised ranking model to re-rank candidates generated from an
SMT-based grammatical error correction (GEC) system. A range of novel features
with respect to GEC are investigated and implemented in our re-ranker. We train
a rank preference SVM model and demonstrate that this outperforms both Minimum
Bayes-Risk and Multi-Engine Machine Translation based re-ranking for the GEC
task. Our best system yields a significant improvement in I-measure when
testing on the publicly available FCE test set (from 2.87% to 9.78%). It also
achieves an F-0.5 score of 38.08% on the CoNLL-2014 shared task test set, which
is higher than the best original result. The oracle score (upper bound) for the
re-ranker achieves over 40% I-measure performance, demonstrating that there is
considerable room for improvement in the re-ranking component developed here,
such as incorporating features able to capture long-distance dependencies.
