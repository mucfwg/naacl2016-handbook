Abstract#==#The Automated Evaluation of Scientific Writing, or AESW, is the task of
identifying sentences in need of correction to ensure their appropriateness in
a scientific prose. The data set comes from a professional editing company,
VTeX, with two aligned versions of the same text – before and after editing
– and covers a variety of textual infelicities that proofreaders have edited.
While previous shared tasks focused solely on grammatical errors (Dale and
Kilgarriff, 2011; Dale et al., 2012; Ng et al., 2013; Ng et al., 2014), this
time edits cover other types of linguistic misfits as well, including those
that almost certainly could be interpreted as style issues and similar "matters
of opinion". The latter arise because of different language editing traditions,
experience, and the absence of uniform agreement on what "good" scientific
language should look like. Initiating this task, we expected the participating
teams to help identify the characteristics of "good" scientific language, and
help create a consensus of which language improvements are acceptable (or
necessary). Six participating teams took on the challenge.
