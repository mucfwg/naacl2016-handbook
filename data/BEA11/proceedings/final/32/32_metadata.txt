Abstract#==#Active learning has been shown to be effective for reducing human labeling
effort in supervised learning tasks,
 and in this work we explore its suitability for automatic short answer
assessment on the ASAP corpus. We systematically investigate a wide range of AL
settings,
varying not only the item selection method but also size and
selection of seed set items and batch size. Comparing to a
random baseline and a recently-proposed diversity-based baseline which
uses cluster centroids as training data, we find that
uncertainty-based sampling methods can be beneficial, especially for
data sets with particular properties. The performance of AL, however,
varies considerably across individual prompts.
