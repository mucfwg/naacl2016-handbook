Abstract#==#In this work, we estimate the deterioration of NLP processing given an estimate
of the amount and nature of grammatical errors in a text. From a corpus of
essays written by English-language learners, we extract ungrammatical
sentences, controlling the number and types of errors in each sentence. We
focus on six categories of errors that are commonly made by English-language
learners, and consider sentences containing one or more of these errors.
To evaluate the effect of grammatical errors, we measure the deterioration of
the ungrammatical dependency parses using the labeled F-score, an adaptation of
the labeled attachment score. We find notable differences between the influence
of individual error types on the dependency parse, as well as interactions
between multiple errors.
