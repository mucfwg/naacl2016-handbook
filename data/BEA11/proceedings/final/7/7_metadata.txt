Abstract#==#In many language learning scenarios, it is important to anticipate spelling
errors. We model the spelling difficulty of words with new features that
capture phonetic phenomena and are based on psycholinguistic findings. To train
our model, we extract more than 140,000 spelling errors from three learner
corpora covering English, German and Italian essays.  Our evaluation shows that
our model can predict spelling difficulty with an accuracy >80\% and reaches a
stable quality across corpora and languages. In addition, we provide a thorough
error analysis that takes the native language of the learners into account and
provides insights into cross-lingual transfer effects.
