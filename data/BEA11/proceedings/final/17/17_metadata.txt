Abstract#==#In spite of methodological and conceptual parallels, the computational
linguistic applications short answer scoring (Burrows et al., 2015), authorship
attribution (Stamatatos, 2009), and plagiarism detection (Zesch and Gurevych,
2012) haven’t been linked in practice. This work explores the practical
usefulness of the combination of features from each of these fields for two
tasks: semantic learner language classification, and plagiarism detection. The
experiments show that incorporating features from the other domain yields
significant improvements. A feature analysis reveals that robust lexical and
semantic features are most informative for these tasks.
