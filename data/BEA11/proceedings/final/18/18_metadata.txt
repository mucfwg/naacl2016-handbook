Abstract#==#Cloze tests, also known as gap-fill exercises, are a popular tool for acquiring
and evaluating                          language proficiency. A major challenge in
the way
of
automating scoring of cloze tests is the yet unsolved problem of gap filler
ambiguity. To address this challenge, we present the concept of bundled gap
filling, along with (1) an efficient computational model for automatically
generating unambiguous gap bundle exercises, and (2) a disambiguation measure
for guiding  the construction of the exercises and validating their level of
ambiguity. Our evaluation shows that our proposed exercises achieve a dramatic
reduction in gap filler ambiguity, while our disambiguation measure can be
effectively used to discard exercises that are nevertheless too ambiguous.
