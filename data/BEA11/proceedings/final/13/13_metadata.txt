Abstract#==#We present, to our knowledge, the first experiments on using NLP  to measure
the extent to which a writing sample expresses the writer's utility value from
studying a STEM subject. Studies in social psychology have shown that a writing
intervention where a STEM student is asked to reflect on the value of the STEM
subject in their personal and social life is effective for improving motivation
and retention of students in STEM  in college. Automated assessment of the
expression of utility value  in student writing would allow scaling the
intervention up, opening access to its benefits to multitudes of  college
students. Our results on biology data suggest that expression of utility value
can be measured with reasonable accuracy using automated means, especially in
personal essays.
