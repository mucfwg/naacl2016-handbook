Abstract#==#Evaluating student answers often requires contextual information, such as
previous utterances in conversational tutoring systems. For example, students
use coreferences and write elliptical responses, i.e. incomplete but can be
interpreted in context. The DT-Grade corpus which we present in this paper
consists of short constructed answers extracted from tutorial dialogues between
students and an Intelligent Tutoring System and annotated for their correctness
in the given context and whether the contextual information was useful. The
dataset contains 900 answers (of which about 25% required contextual
information to properly interpret them). We also present a baseline system
developed to predict the correctness label (such as correct, correct but
incomplete) in which weights for the words are assigned based on context.
