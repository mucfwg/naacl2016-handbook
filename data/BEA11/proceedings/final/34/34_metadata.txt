Abstract#==#In this paper, we address the problem of quantifying the overall extent to
which a test-taker's essay deals with the topic it is assigned (prompt).  We
experiment with a number of models for word topicality, and a number of
approaches for aggregating word-level indices into text-level ones. All models
are evaluated for their ability to predict the holistic quality of essays. We
show that the best text-topicality model provides a significant improvement in
a  state-of-art essay scoring system. We also show that the findings of the
relative merits of different models  generalize well across three different
datasets.
