Abstract#==#In this paper, we propose a graph-based translation model which takes advantage
of discontinuous phrases. The model segments a graph which combines bigram and
dependency relations into subgraphs and produces translations by combining
translations of these subgraphs. Experiments on Chinese--English and
German--English tasks show that our system is significantly better than the
phrase-based model. By explicitly modeling the graph segmentation, our system
gains further improvement.
