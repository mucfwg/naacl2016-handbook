Abstract#==#This research puts forward two concepts, the Naming Sharing Structure (NSS) and
the Naming-Telling clause (NT clause). By trans-forming linear text into a
plane structure, we discovered five construction patterns of NT clause for the
NSS. The constructions of NT clauses are order-preserving, non-transgressive,
and syntactically well-formed. These features of NT clause can be explained
from the point of view of cognition.
