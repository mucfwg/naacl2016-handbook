Abstract#==#This paper describes a deterministic method for generating natural language
suited to being part of a machine translation system with meaning
representations as the level for language transfer. Starting from
Davidsonian/Penman meaning representations, syntactic trees are built following
the Penn Parsed Corpus of Modern British English, from which the yield (i.e.,
the words) can be taken. The novel contribution is to highlight exploiting the
presentation of meaning content to inform decisions regarding the selection of
language constructions: active vs. passive, argument subject vs. expletive it
vs. existential there, discourse vs. intra-sentential coordination vs.
adverbial clause vs. participial clause vs. purpose clause, and infinitive
clause vs. finite clause vs. small clause vs. relative clause vs. it cleft.
