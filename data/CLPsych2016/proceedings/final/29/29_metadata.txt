Abstract#==#In this paper, we present our methods for the 2016 CLPPsych shared task. We
extracted and selected eight features from the corpus consisting of posts from
ReachOut.com including the information of the postâ€™s source board, numbers of
kudos and views, post time, ranks of the authors, unigram of the body and
subject, frequency of the used emotion icons, and the topic model features. Two
support vector machine models were trained with the extracted features. A
baseline system was also developed, which uses the calculated log likelihood
ratio (LLR) for each token to rank a post. Finally, the prediction results of
the above three systems were integrated by using a global ranking algorithm
with the weighted Borda-fuse (WBF) model and the linear combination model. The
best F-score achieved by our systems is 0.3 which is based on the global
ranking method with WBF.
