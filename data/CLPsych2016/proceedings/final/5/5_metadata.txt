Abstract#==#The need to protect privacy poses unique challenges to behavioral research. For
instance, researchers often can not use examples drawn directly from such data
to explain or illustrate key findings. In this research, we use data-driven
models to synthesize realistic-looking data, focusing on discourse produced by
social-media participants announcing life-changing events. We comparatively
explore the performance of distinct techniques for generating synthetic
linguistic data across different linguistic units and topics. 
Our approach offers utility not only for reporting on qualitative behavioral
research on such data, where directly quoting a participant's content can
unintentionally reveal sensitive information about the participant, but also
for clinical computational system developers, for whom access to realistic
synthetic data may be sufficient for the software development process.
Accordingly, thi work also has implications for computational linguistics at
large.
