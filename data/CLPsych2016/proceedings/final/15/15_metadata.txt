Abstract#==#The phenotypic complexity of Autism Spectrum Disorder motivates the application
of modern computational methods to large collections of observational data,
both for improved clinical diagnosis and for better scientific understanding.
We have begun to create a corpus of annotated language samples relevant to this
research, and we plan to join with other researchers in pooling and publishing
such resources on a large scale. The goal of this paper is to present some
initial explorations to illustrate the opportunities that such datasets will
afford.
