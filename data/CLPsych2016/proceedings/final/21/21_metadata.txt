Abstract#==#As part of the 2016 Computational Linguistics and Clinical Psychology (CLPsych)
shared task, participants were asked to construct systems to automatically
classify mental health forum posts into four categories, representing how
urgently posts require moderator attention. This paper details the system
implementation from the University of Florida, in which we compare several
distinct models and show that best performance is achieved with domain-specific
preprocessing, n-gram feature extraction, and cross-validated linear models.
