Abstract#==#Online social media, such as Reddit, has become an important resource to share
personal experiences and communicate with others. Among other personal
information, some social media users communicate about mental health problems
they are experiencing, with the intention of getting advice, support or empathy
from other users. Here, we investigate the language of Reddit posts specific to
mental health, to define linguistic characteristics that could be helpful for
further applications. The latter include attempting to identify posts that need
urgent attention due to their nature, e.g. when someone announces their
intentions of ending their life by suicide or harming others. Our results show
that there are a variety of linguistic features that are discriminative across
mental health user communities and that can be further exploited in subsequent
classification tasks. Furthermore, while negative sentiment is almost uniformly
expressed across the entire data set, we demonstrate that there are also
condition-specific vocabularies used in social media to communicate about
particular disorders. Source code and related materials are available from:
