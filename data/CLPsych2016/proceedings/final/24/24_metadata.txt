Abstract#==#The 2016 ACL Workshop on Computational Linguistics and Clinical Psychology
(CLPsych) included a shared task focusing on classification of posts to
ReachOut, an online information and support service that provides help to teens
and young adults (aged 15-24) who are struggling with mental health issues. The
primary goal of the shared task is to identify posts that require urgent
attention and review from the ReachOut team (i.e.moderators). GW/UMD best
official submission yielded 0:36% macro-F1, which is 6% short of the best
system. However, further feature experimentation after the conclusion of the
shared task yielded a macro F1 score of 0:45%.
