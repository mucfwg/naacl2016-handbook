Abstract#==#We present an approach for automatic triage of message posts in ReachOut.com
mental health forum, which was a shared task in the 2016 Computational
Linguistics and Clinical Psychology (CLPsych). This effort is aimed at
providing the trained moderators of ReachOut.com  with a systematic triage of
forum posts, enabling them to more efficiently support the young users aged
14-25 communicating with each other about their issues. We use different
features and classifiers to predict the users' mental health states, marked as
green, amber, red, and crisis. Our results show that random forests have
significant success over our baseline mutli-class SVM classifier. In addition,
we perform feature importance analysis to characterize key features in
identification of the critical posts.
