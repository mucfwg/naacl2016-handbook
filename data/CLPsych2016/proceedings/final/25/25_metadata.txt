Abstract#==#Online mental health forums provide users with an anonymous support platform
that is facilitated by moderators responsible for finding and addressing
critical posts, especially those related to self-harm. Given the seriousness of
these posts, it is important that the moderators are able to locate these
critical posts quickly in order to respond with timely support. We approached
the task of automatically triaging forum posts as a multiclass classification
problem. Our model uses a supervised classifier with various features including
lexical, psycholinguistic, and topic modeling features. On a dataset of mental
forum posts from ReachOut.com, our approach identified critical cases with a
F-score of over 80%, showing the effectiveness of the model. Among 16
participating teams and 60 total runs, our best run achieved macro-average
F1-score of 41% for the critical categories (The best score among all the runs
was 42%).
