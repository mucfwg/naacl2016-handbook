Abstract#==#As self-directed online anxiety treatment and e-mental health programs become
more prevalent and begin to rapidly scale to a large number of users, the need
to develop automated techniques for monitoring patient progress and detecting
early warning signs is at an all-time high. While current online therapy
systems work based on explicit quantitative feedback from various survey
measures, little attention has been paid thus far to the large amount of
unstructured free text present in the monitoring logs and journals submitted by
patients as part of the treatment process. In this paper, we automatically
categorize patients' internal sentiment and emotions using machine learning
classifiers based on n-grams, syntactic patterns, sentiment lexicon features,
and distributed word embeddings. We report classification metrics on a novel
mental health dataset.
