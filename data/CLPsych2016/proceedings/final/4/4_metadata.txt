Abstract#==#Dementia is an increasing problem for an aging population, with a lack of
available treatment
options, as well as expensive patient care. Early detection is critical to
eventually
postpone symptoms and to prepare health care providers and families for
managing a
patient’s needs. Identification of diagnostic markers may be possible with
patients’ clinical
records. Text portions of clinical records are integrated into predictive
models of dementia
development in order to gain insights towards automated identification of
patients
who may benefit from providers’ early assessment. Results support the
potential power
of linguistic records for predicting dementia status, both in the absence of,
and in
complement to, corresponding structured nonlinguistic data.
