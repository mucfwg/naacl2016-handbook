Abstract#==#Many people with mental illnesses face challenges posed by stigma perpetuated
by fear and misconception in society at large. This societal stigma against
mental health conditions is present in everyday language. In this study we take
a set of 14 words with the potential to stigmatize mental health and sample
Twitter as an approximation of contemporary discourse. Annotation reveals that
these words are used with different senses, from expressive to stigmatizing to
clinical. We use these word-sense annotations to extract a set of mental
health--aware Twitter users, and compare their language use to that of an age-
and gender-matched comparison set of users, discovering a difference in
frequency of stigmatizing senses as well as a change in the target of
pejorative senses. Such analysis may provide a first step towards a tool with
the potential to help everyday people to increase awareness of their own
stigmatizing language, and to measure the effectiveness of anti-stigma
campaigns to change our discourse.
