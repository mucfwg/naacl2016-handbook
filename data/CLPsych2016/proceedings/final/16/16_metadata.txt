Abstract#==#The 2016 CLPsych Shared Task was to automatically triage posts from a mental
health forum into four categories:  "green" (everything is fine), "amber" (a
moderator needs to look at this post), "red" (a moderator urgently needs to
look at this post) and "crisis" (the person might hurt himself or others). The
final results for the task revealed that this problem was not an easy task. I
chose to treat the problem as a text categorization task using a system
composed of different Support Vector Machines (SVMs) in a one-vs-rest setting.
This approach was straight-forward and achieved good performance in the final
evaluation. The major difficulty was to find suitable features and feature
combinations.
