Abstract#==#This article explores how to build a system
for detecting posts in need of attention on
ReachOut.com forums. The proposed method uses Tree Kernels over binary Support
Vector Machines classification and linear regression, comparing these two
machine learning techniques.
Predictions from one of these systems were submitted to the CLPsych 2016 Shared
Task. Nonetheless, results indicate that it is possible to build an accurate
system using only text features without the use of other meta data.
