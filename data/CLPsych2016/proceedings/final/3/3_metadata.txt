Abstract#==#Alzheimer's disease (AD) and depression share a number of symptoms, and
commonly occur together. Being able to differentiate between these two
conditions is critical, as depression is generally treatable. We use linguistic
analysis and machine learning to determine whether automated screening
algorithms for AD are affected by depression, and to detect when individuals
diagnosed with AD are also showing signs of depression. In the first case, we
find that our automated AD screening procedure does not show false positives
for individuals who have depression but are otherwise healthy. In the second
case, we have moderate success in detecting signs of depression in AD (accuracy
= 0.649), but we are not able to draw a strong conclusion about the features
which are most informative to the classification.
