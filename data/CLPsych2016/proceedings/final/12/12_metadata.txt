Abstract#==#The sharing of emotional material is central to the process of psychotherapy
and emotional problems are a primary reason for seeking treatment. 
Surprisingly, very little systematic research has been done on patterns of
emotional exchange during psychotherapy.  It is likely that a major reason for
this void in the research is the enormous cost of annotating sessions for
affective content.  In the field of NLP, there have been major strides in the
creation of algorithms for sentiment analysis, but most of this work has
focused on written reviews of movies and twitter feeds with little work on
spoken dialogue.  We have created a new database of 97,497 utterances from
psychotherapy transcripts labeled by humans for sentiment.  We describe this
dataset and present initial results for models identifying sentiment. We also
show that one of the best models from the literature, trained on movie reviews,
performed below many of our baseline models that trained on the psychotherapy
corpus.
