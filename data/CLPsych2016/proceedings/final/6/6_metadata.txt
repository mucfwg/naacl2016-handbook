Abstract#==#Tragically, an estimated 42,000 Americans died by suicide in 2015, each one
deeply affecting friends and family. 
Very little data and information is available about people who attempt to take
their life, 
and thus scientific exploration has been hampered. 
We examine data from Twitter users who have attempted 
to take their life and provide an exploratory analysis 
of patterns in language and emotions around their 
attempt. We also show differences between 
those who have attempted to take their life 
and matched controls. We find quantifiable 
signals of suicide attempts in the language of 
social media data and estimate performance 
of a simple machine learning classifier with 
these signals as a non-invasive analysis in a screening process.
