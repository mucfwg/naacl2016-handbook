Abstract#==#We report on a multiclass classifier for triage of mental health forum posts as
part of the CLPsych 2016 shared task. We investigate a number of document
representations, including topic models and representation learning to
represent posts in semantic space, including context- and emotion-sensitive
feature representations of posts.
