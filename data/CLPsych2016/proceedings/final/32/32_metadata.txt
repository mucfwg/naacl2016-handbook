Abstract#==#We detail our approach to the CLPsych 2016 triage of mental health forum posts
shared task. We experiment with a number of features in a logistic regression
classification approach. Our baseline approach with lexical features from a
post and previous posts in the reply chain gives our best performance of 0.33,
which is roughly the median for the task.
