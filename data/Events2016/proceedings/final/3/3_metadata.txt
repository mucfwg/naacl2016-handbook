Abstract#==#We describe the ongoing development of a lexically-informed, upper-level event
ontology and explore use cases of the ontology.  This ontology draws its
lexical sense distinctions from VerbNet, FrameNet and the Rich Entities,
Relations and Events Project.  As a result, the ontology facilitates
interoperability and the combination of annotations done for each independent
resource.  While this ontology is intended to be practical for a variety of
applications, here we take the initial steps in determining whether or not the
event ontology could be utilized in multimodal applications, specifically to
recognize and reason about events in both text and video.  We find that the
ontology facilitates the generalization of potentially noisy or sparse
individual realizations of events into larger categories of events and enables
reasoning about event relations and participants, both of which are useful in
event recognition and interpretation regardless of modality.
