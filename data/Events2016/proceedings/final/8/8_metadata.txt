Abstract#==#Common sense knowledge plays an essential role for natural language
understanding, human-machine communication and so forth. In this paper, we
acquire knowledge of events as common sense knowledge because there is a
possibility that dictionaries of such knowledge are useful for recognition of
implication relations in texts, inference of human activities and their
planning, and so on. As for event knowledge, we focus on feature changes of
arguments (hereafter, FCAs) in event sentences as knowledge of events. To
construct a dictionary of FCAs, we propose a framework for acquiring such
knowledge based on both of the automatic approach and the collective
intelligence approach to exploit merits of both approaches. We acquired FCAs in
event sentences through crowdsourcing and conducted the subjective evaluation
to validate whether the FCAs are adequately acquired. As a result of the
evaluation, it was shown that we were able to reasonably well capture FCAs in
event sentences.
