Abstract#==#Most events described in a news article are background events, and
only a small number are note-worthy, which serve as the trigger for
writing of that article. Although these noteworthy events are
difficult to identify, they are crucial to NLP tasks such as first
story detection, document summarization and event coreference, and to
many applications of event analysis that depend on event counting and
identifying trends. In this work, we introduce the notion of
news-peg, a concept borrowed from the political science
literature, in an attempt to remedy this problem. A news-peg is an
event which prompted the author to write the article, and it serves
as a more fine-grained measure of noteworthiness than a summary. We
describe a new task of news-peg identification and release an
annotated dataset for its evaluation. We formalize an operational
definition of a news-peg, on which human annotators achieve high
inter-annotator agreement, and present a rule-based system for this
task, which exploits syntactic features derived from established
journalistic devices.
