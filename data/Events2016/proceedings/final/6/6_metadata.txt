Abstract#==#This paper will discuss and compare event representations across a variety of
types of event annotation: Rich Entities, Relations, and Events (Rich ERE),
Light Entities, Relations, and Events (Light ERE), Event Nugget (EN), Event
Argument Extraction (EAE), Richer Event Descriptions (RED), and Event-Event
Relations (EER).  Comparisons of event representations are presented, along
with a comparison of data annotated according to each event representation.  An
event annotation experiment is also discussed, including annotation for all of
these representations on the same set of sample data, with the purpose of being
able to compare actual annotation across all of these approaches as directly as
possible. We walk through a brief example to illustrate the various annotation
approaches, and to show the intersections among the various annotated data
sets.
