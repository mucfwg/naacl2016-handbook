Abstract#==#Causal and temporal relations among events
are typically analyzed in terms of interclausal
relations. Yet participants in a monoclausal
event interact causally as well, and monoclausal
events unfold in temporal phases. We
propose an annotation scheme for the resulting
analysis of event structure types. The annotation
scheme is based on a fine-grained analysis
of aspectual structure combined with a
novel analysis of physical event types based
on proposals in the theoretical linguistics literature.
By decomposing complex events in
a clause, we will ultimately model the overall
dynamic causal network of entities interacting
over time described in a text.
