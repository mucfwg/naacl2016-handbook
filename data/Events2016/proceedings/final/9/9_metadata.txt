Abstract#==#Learning commonsense causal and temporal relation between events is one of the
major steps towards deeper language understanding. This is even more crucial
for understanding stories and script learning. A prerequisite for learning
scripts is a semantic framework which enables capturing rich event structures.
In this paper we introduce a novel semantic annotation framework, called Causal
and Temporal Relation Scheme (CaTeRS), which is unique in simultaneously
capturing a comprehensive set of temporal and causal relations between events.
By annotating a total of 1,600 sentences in the context of 320 five-sentence
short stories sampled from ROCStories corpus, we demonstrate that these stories
are indeed full of causal and temporal relations. Furthermore, we show that the
CaTeRS annotation scheme enables high inter-annotator agreement for
broad-coverage event entity annotation and moderate agreement on semantic link
annotation.
