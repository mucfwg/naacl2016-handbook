Abstract#==#In this paper, we describe the event nugget annotation created in support of
the pilot Event Nugget Detection evaluation in 2014 and in support of the Event
Nugget Detec-tion and Coreference open evaluation in 2015, which was one of the
Knowledge Base Population tracks within the NIST Text Analysis Conference. We
present the data volume annotated for both training and evaluation data for the
2015 evaluation as well as changes to annotation in 2015 as compared to that of
2014. We also analyze the annotation for the 2015 evaluation as an example to
show the annotation chal-lenges and consistency, and identify the event types
and subtypes that are most dif-ficult for human annotators. Finally, we discuss
annotation issues that we need to take into consideration in the future.
