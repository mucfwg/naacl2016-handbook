Abstract#==#Embedding-based Knowledge Base Completion models have so far mostly combined
distributed representations of individual entities or relations to compute
truth scores of missing links. Facts can however also be represented using
pairwise embeddings, i.e. embeddings for pairs of entities and relations. In
this paper we explore such bigram embeddings with a flexible Factorization
Machine model and several ablations from it. We investigate the relevance of
various pair types on the fb15k237 dataset and find relative improvements
compared to a compositional model.
