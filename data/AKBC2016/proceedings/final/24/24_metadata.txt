Abstract#==#Relation extraction is one of the core challenges in automated knowledge base
construction. One line of approach for relation extraction is to perform
multi-hop reasoning on the paths connecting an entity pair to infer new
relations. While these methods have been successfully applied for knowledge
base completion, they do not utilize the entity or the entity  type information
to make predictions. In this work, we incorporate {\it selectional
preferences}, i.e., relations enforce constraints on the allowed entity types
for the candidate entities,  to multi-hop relation extraction by including
entity type information.  We achieve a 17.67% relative improvement in MAP score
in a
relation extraction task when compared to a method that does not use entity
type information.
