Abstract#==#We present a design for acquiring word association knowledge of high
quality on the basis of a game with a purpose (GWAP). We evaluate
automatically acquired word associations using a word association game
as a GWAP. In the word association game, a player is given a set of
associated words as a hint and is asked to answer a word that can be
associated with the hint. If many players can answer the correct
keyword, we judge the set of associated words to be of high
quality. This word association game was implemented in a
smartphone-based dialog system, which has been installed into more than
one million smartphones. Our analysis of numerous game logs
demonstrated that our framework can effectively select word
associations of high quality.
