Abstract#==#Knowledge bases such as Wikidata, DBpedia, YAGO, or the Google Knowledge Vault
collect a vast number of facts about the world. But while quite some facts are
known about the world, little is known about how much is unknown. For example,
while the knowledge base may tell us that Barack Obama is the father of Malia
Obama and Sasha Obama, it does not tell us whether these are all of his
children. This is not just an epistemic challenge, but also a practical problem
for data producers and consumers. We envision that KBs become annotated with
information about their recall on specific topics. We show what such
annotations could look like, how they could be obtained, and survey related
work.
