Abstract#==#We propose a general approach to modeling semi-supervised learning constraints
on unlabeled data. Both traditional supervised classification tasks and many
natural semi-supervised learning heuristics can be approximated by specifying
the desired outcome of walks through a graph of classifiers. We demonstrate the
modeling capability of this approach in the task of relation extraction, and
experimental results show that the modeled constraints achieve better
performance as expected.
