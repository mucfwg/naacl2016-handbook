Abstract#==#Recent work on information extraction has suggested that fast, interactive
tools can be highly effective; however, creating a usable system is
challenging, and few publically available tools exist. In this paper we present
IKE, a new extraction tool that performs fast, interactive bootstrapping to
develop high-quality extraction patterns for targeted relations. Central to IKE
is the notion that an extraction pattern can be treated as a search query over
a corpus. To operationalize this, IKE uses a novel query language that is
expressive, easy to understand, and fast to execute - essential requirements
for a practical system. It is also the first interactive extraction tool to
seamlessly integrate symbolic (boolean) and distributional (similarity-based)
methods for search. An initial evaluation suggests that relation tables can be
populated substantially faster than by manual pattern
authoring while retaining accuracy, and more reliably than fully automated
tools, an important
step towards practical KB construction. We are making IKE publicly available
(http://allenai.org/software/interactive-knowledge-extraction).
