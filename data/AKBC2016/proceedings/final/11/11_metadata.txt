Abstract#==#With the rise in popularity of social media, images accompanied by contextual
text form a huge section of the web. However, search and retrieval of documents
are still largely dependent on solely textual cues. Although visual cues have
started to gain focus, the imperfection in object/scene detection do not lead
to significantly improved results. We hypothesize that the use of background
commonsense knowledge on query terms can significantly aid in retrieval of
documents with associated images. To this end we deploy three different
modalities - text, visual cues, and commonsense knowledge pertaining to the
query - as a recipe for efficient search and retrieval.
