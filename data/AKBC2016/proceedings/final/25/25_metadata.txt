Abstract#==#This paper is an attempt to raise pertinent questions and act as platform to
generate fruitful discussions within the AKBC community about the need for a
large scale dataset for relation extraction. For proper training and evaluation
of relation extraction tasks, the weaknesses of datasets used so far need to be
tackled: mainly the size (too small) and the amount of data that is actually
labelled (unlabelled data leading to recall problems). We have the vision of
building a new large and fully labelled dataset for entity pairs connected via
binary relations from both Freebase as well as other datasets, such as Clueweb.
Concerning the process of building, we present pioneering work on a roadmap
which will serve as the foundation for the intended discussion within the
community. Points to discuss arise within the following steps: first, the
source data has to be preprocessed in order to ensure that the set of relations
consists of valid relations only; second, we suggest a method to find the most
relevant relations for an entity pair; and third, we outline approaches on how
to actually label the data. It is necessary to discuss several key issues in
the process of generating this dataset. This will enable us to thoroughly
create a dataset that will have the potential to serve as a standard to the
community.
