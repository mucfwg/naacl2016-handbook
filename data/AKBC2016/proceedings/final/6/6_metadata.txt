Abstract#==#A prior study found that on average there are 6.3 named mentions of
organizations found in email messages from the Enron collection, only about
half of which could be linked to known entities in Wikipedia. That suggests a
need for collection-specific approaches to entity linking, similar to those
have proven successful for person mentions. This paper describes a process for
automatically constructing such a collection-specific knowledge base of
organization entities for named mentions in Enron. A new public test collection
for linking 130 mentions of organizations found in Enron email to either
Wikipedia or to this new collection-specific knowledge base is also described.
Together, Wikipedia entities plus the new collection-specific knowledge base
cover 83% of the 130 organization mentions, a 14% (absolute) improvement over
the 69% that could be linked to Wikipedia alone.
