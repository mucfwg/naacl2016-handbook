Abstract#==#We propose an approach to extracting information from text based on the
hypothesis that text sometimes describes the world. The hypothesis is embodied
in a generative probability model that describes (1) possible worlds and the
facts they might contain, (2) how an author chooses facts to express, and (3)
how those facts are expressed in text. Given text, information extraction is
done by computing a posterior over the worlds that might have generated it. As
a by-product, this unsupervised learning process discovers new relations and
their textual expressions, extracts new facts, disambiguates instances of
polysemous expressions, and resolves entity references. The probability model
also explains and improves on Brinâ€™s bootstrapping heuristic, which underlies
many open information extraction systems. Preliminary results on a small corpus
of New York Times text suggest that the approach is effective.
