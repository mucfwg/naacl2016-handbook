Abstract#==#Most question answering systems use symbolic or text information. We present a
dataset for a task that requires understanding descriptions of visual themes
and their layout: identifying paintings from their descriptions. We annotate
paintings with contour data, align regions with entity mentions from an
ontology, and associate image regions with text spans from descriptions. A
simple embedding-based method applied to text-to-image coreferences achieves
state-of-the-art results on our task when paired with bipartite matching. The
task is made all the more difficult by scarcity of training data.
