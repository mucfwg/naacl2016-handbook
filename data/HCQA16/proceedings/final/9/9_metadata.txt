Abstract#==#This paper presents an end-to-end neural network model, named Neural Generative
Question Answering (genQA), that can generate answers to simple factoid
questions, based on the facts in a knowledge-base. More specifically, the model
is built on the encoder-decoder framework for sequence-to-sequence learning,
while equipped with the ability to enquire the knowledge-base, and is trained
on a corpus of question-answer pairs, with their associated triples in the
knowledge-base. Empirical study shows the proposed model can effectively deal
with the variations of questions and answers, and generate right and natural
answers by referring to the facts in the knowledge-base. The experiment on
question answering demonstrates that the proposed model can outperform an
embedding-based QA model as well as a neural dialogue model trained on the same
data.
