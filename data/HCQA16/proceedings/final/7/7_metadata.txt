Abstract#==#We propose NEURAL ENQUIRER — a neural network architecture for answering
natural language (NL) questions given a knowledge base (KB) table. Unlike
previous work on end-to-end training of semantic parsers, NEURAL ENQUIRER is
fully “neuralized”: it gives distributed representations of queries and KB
tables, and executes queries through a series of differentiable operations. The
model can be trained with gradient descent using both end- to-end and
step-by-step supervision. During training the representations of queries and
the KB table are jointly optimized with the query execution logic. Our
experiments show that the model can learn to execute complex NL queries on KB
tables with rich structures.
