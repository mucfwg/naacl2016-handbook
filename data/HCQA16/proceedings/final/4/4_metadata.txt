Abstract#==#We propose a new open question answering framework for question answering over
a
knowledge base (KB). Our system uses both a curated KB, Freebase, and one that
is extracted automatically by an open information extraction model, IE KB. Our
system consists of only one layer of paraphrase, compared to the three layers
used in a previous open question answering system (Fader et al., 2014).
However, because of the more accurately extracted relation triples in IE KB,
combined with linked entities from IE KB to Freebase, our system achieves a 7%
absolute gain in F1 score over the previous system.
