Abstract#==#Modern search engines have made dramatic progress in the answering of many
user's questions about facts, such as those that might be retrieved or directly
inferred from a knowledge base.
However, many other questions that real users ask are more complex, such as
asking for opinions or advice for a particular situation, and are still largely
beyond the competence of the computer systems.
As conversational agents become more popular, QA systems are increasingly
expected to handle such complex questions, and to do so in (nearly) real-time,
as the searcher is unlikely to wait longer than a minute or two for an answer.
One way to overcome some of the challenges in complex question answering is
crowdsourcing.
We explore two ways crowdsourcing can assist a question answering system that
operates in (near) real time: by providing answer validation, which could be
used to filter or re-rank the candidate answers, and by creating the answer
candidates directly.
Specifically, we focus on understanding the effects of time restrictions in the
near real-time QA setting.
Our experiments show that even within a one minute time limit, crowd workers
can produce reliable ratings for up to three answer candidates, and generate
answers that are better than an average automated system from the LiveQA 2015
shared task.
Our findings can be useful for developing hybrid human-computer systems for
automatic question answering and conversational agents.
